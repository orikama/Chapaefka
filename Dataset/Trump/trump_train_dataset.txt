./myfolder/VOICE/01-001.wav|Our country is currently facing a crisis of illegal immigration on our southern border;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-002.wav|Democrat-supported loopholes in our federal laws have enabled roughly half a million illegal immigrant family members and minors;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-003.wav|from Central America to be released into the United States since two thousand fourteen at unbelievably tremendous taxpayer expense;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-004.wav|While illegal aliens can only be held for a period of days or weeks, it can take years to move their cases through the legal system to actually try to send them back to their home countries;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-005.wav|It is a ridiculous process;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-006.wav|For example, of the removal orders issued for unaccompanied alien children over a recent two-year period, ninety percent were done in absentia;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-007.wav|That means they weren't there and they never showed up for their removal hearing;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-008.wav|What else is new;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-009.wav|The United States cannot have an open border to every illegal alien family and minor on the face of the earth;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-010.wav|We must have rules we must have laws and we must enforce those laws;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-011.wav|The driving factor in this surge of illegal families and minors is the belief that there will be no consequence for illegal entry, and no likelihood of removal or reprisal;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-012.wav|Unfortunately open border Democrats support the loopholes that prevent families from being detained and removed together;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-013.wav|They just want everyone to be released into our country no matter how dangerous they are;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-014.wav|They can be killers they can be thieves they can be horrible people;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-015.wav|The Democrats say it's okay for them to be in our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-016.wav|I don't think so;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-017.wav|Congress and Congress alone can solve the problem;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-018.wav|And the only solution that will work is being able to detain, prosecute and promptly remove anyone who illegally crosses the border;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-019.wav|Remember this, we need Democrat votes;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-020.wav|Without the Democrats constantly obstructing, there's no way you can do it without having Democrats voting, there is no way you can get this done;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-021.wav|So the Democrats are obstructing, the Democrats don't want border security, the Democrats are okay with crime, but we're not okay with it;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-022.wav|We need Democrat votes;
./myfolder/VOICE/01-023.wav|Without it, frankly, nothing can be done;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-001.wav|Every day at five twenty-three;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-002.wav|I feel like she's going to come through that door;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-003.wav|but I know she's not;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-004.wav|Those are the words;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-005.wav|and heartbreaking they are;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-006.wav|of Elizabeth Alvarado;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-007.wav|who's beautiful fifteen year old daughter Nisa;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-008.wav|along with her friend Kala;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-009.wav|was brutally murdered;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-010.wav|by a gang of vile savages known as MS thirteen;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-011.wav|You've all heard of them, they're bad;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-012.wav|Everywhere they go, the thousands of MS thirteen gang members;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-013.wav|who have infiltrated our country so illegally and so violently;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-014.wav|live by their gruesome motto, kill, rape, control;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-015.wav|Just weeks ago, an illegal MS thirteen gang member, was arrested for allegedly murdering a man;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-016.wav|and burning his body;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-017.wav|The gang member reportedly entered, our country, through glaring loopholes, for unaccompanied alien minors;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-018.wav|The Democrats allow those loopholes to be there;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-019.wav|They could change them so easily, but they don't want to do that for strictly political reasons;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-020.wav|In Texas, two MS thirteen members were charged after allegedly kidnapping, drugging and raping a fourteen year-old girl and then murdering someone else;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-021.wav|In Maryland MS thirteen gang members are accused of stabbing a man one hundred times, decapitating him, and ripping out his heart;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-022.wav|Police also believe MS thirteen members beat a sex-trafficked fifteen year old girl with a bat twenty eight times badly disfiguring her body and her face;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-023.wav|MS thirteen has infiltrated many schools across America;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-024.wav|A recent newspaper report details how a middle school in Maryland is suffering from violent MS thirteen gang activity;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-025.wav|including drug dealing;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-026.wav|attempted gang recruitment, daily fighting, and alleged assault;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-027.wav|MS thirteen gang members;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-028.wav|are truly;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-029.wav|and you've heard me say it, animals;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-030.wav|And yet, Nancy Pelosi and Washington Democrats continue to protect them;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-031.wav|and to push for open borders;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-032.wav|They want them taken care of, they want them to be left alone;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-033.wav|The record is plain;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-034.wav|Washington Democrats voted against Kate's Law;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-035.wav|they voted against legislation to deport gang members;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-036.wav|and they voted for sanctuary cities, where these violent criminals hide;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-037.wav|Democrats in Congress have opposed every measure that would close these immigration loopholes and bring the slaughter to an end;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-038.wav|Americans must demand their lawmakers support the legislation we need to defeat MS thirteen once and for all;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-039.wav|And to ensure every American child in every American community can grow up in safety;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-040.wav|and grow up in security and in peace;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-041.wav|We have a great country, I want to keep it that way and you want me to keep it that way;
./myfolder/VOICE/02-042.wav|Thank you very much;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-001.wav|Senate Democrats call it the resistance;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-002.wav|they're resisting the will of the American Voter and it is not good;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-003.wav|From day one Senate Democrats have shamelessly obstructed, stalled and filibustered the confirmations of hundreds of talented men and women who are eager to come to Washington DC to make a difference;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-004.wav|They want to serve our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-005.wav|My nominees face a longer average confirmation wait than any in the history of our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-006.wav|Today, more than three hundred of our nominees are still awaiting a vote;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-007.wav|Last June I nominated Isabel Patelunas, to serve as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Intelligence and Analysis;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-008.wav|Now almost a year later, this tremendously qualified professional with nearly three decades of intelligence experience is still awaiting confirmation;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-009.wav|She's given up so much;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-010.wav|She's left areas;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-011.wav|She's moved from homes and she's still not confirmed, it's a disgrace;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-012.wav|Democrats in Congress are also blocking urgently needed improvements to our border security;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-013.wav|They don't want border security for two reasons;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-014.wav|Number one they don't care about it;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-015.wav|Number two they are afraid it's going to make me and the republicans look good and they don't want that;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-016.wav|That comes before our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-017.wav|They have blocked every effort to close deadly loopholes, to keep out vicious criminals and to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-018.wav|They are a disaster at the border;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-019.wav|These actions are endangering our citizens, threatening our communities and undermining our national security;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-020.wav|It is time for Senate Democrats to stop resisting the will of the American People;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-021.wav|So very simply, stop resisting the will of the American People and to start working across the aisle to deliver for all citizens;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-022.wav|We love our country, we want to keep our country great;
./myfolder/VOICE/03-023.wav|Thank you very much;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-001.wav|My fellow Americans, this Sunday is one of the most important days of the year, Mother's Day;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-002.wav|It's a special opportunity to thank all of the mothers and grandmothers in our lives;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-003.wav|Since the earliest days of our Republic, America's strength has come from the love and courage and devotion, of our mothers;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-004.wav|They helped us gain our independence;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-005.wav|Through their grit determination and incredible spirit;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-006.wav|they pioneered the West and settled the frontier;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-007.wav|During World War Two America's mothers helped build the greatest arsenal for democracy;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-008.wav|My mother was a great person;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-009.wav|Her name was Mary MacLeod She cam from Scotland and she met my father when she was very young;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-010.wav|They were married for many many years I learned so much from my mother;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-011.wav|She was just incredible, warm, loving, really smart;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-012.wav|Could be tough if she had to be, but basically she was a really nice person;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-013.wav|So much of what I've done and so much of what I've become;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-014.wav|is because of my mother;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-015.wav|I miss her a lot;
./myfolder/VOICE/04-016.wav|So I say this to you as I think about my mother, Happy Mother's Day and God bless the United States of America;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-001.wav|Hello it's great to be with you;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-002.wav|I want to talk about opioid addiction which claimed an average of one hundred and sixteen American lives every single day in two thousand sixteen;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-003.wav|My administration is committed to using every tool at our disposal to combat the opioid epidemic;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-004.wav|That includes getting tough on the drug dealers and pushes, peddling this poison in our communities;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-005.wav|We have to get really really tough really nasty whatever it takes, because we have to keep them out of our country out of our communities;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-006.wav|it also involves all of us preventing misuse from starting at home;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-007.wav|Tomorrow is National Prescription Drug Take Back day a day where we're calling all Americans to prevent pill abuse and theft;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-008.wav|By cleaning their homes of potentially dangerous expired and unneeded prescription drugs, very very important;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-009.wav|Opioid abuse and addiction can impact anyone and everyone knows someone who's been impacted that's why we call it the crisis next door;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-010.wav|Most Americans who abuse prescription drugs get them from someone else's leftover prescriptions;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-011.wav|In fact misusing prescription opioids can be a gateway to deadly heroin addiction or the unsuspecting use of fentanyl lace drugs;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-012.wav|That is why National Take Back day is so vitally important;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-013.wav|On last October's national take back day Americans turned in more than nine hundred thousand pounds of unneeded or expired drugs;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-014.wav|This year with your help we can do even better;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-015.wav|Use this Saturday to clean out your medicine cabinet, to get rid of your unneeded or expired pills so that your home does not contribute to an overdose or create or fuel and Abuse or addiction problem;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-016.wav|Protect your friends, protect your family, protect your love ones;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-017.wav|Find a participating safe disposal site near you by visiting Take Back Day dot DEA dot gov and together we will fight this crisis;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-018.wav|Last week I had the honor of visiting the dedicated service members at joint inter agency task force south headquartered in Key West Florida, working with partners across this hemisphere;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-019.wav|The task force is the international nerve center for drug interdiction efforts they do truly amazing life saving work every single day;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-020.wav|We must make sure that our Coast Guard members serving on the front lines are given the resources they need to defend America and our vital interests in our own hemisphere;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-021.wav|As they work to prevent drugs from entering our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-022.wav|We must do our part by making sure that leftover expired pills are not adding to the death and destruction among our fellow Americans, we have to take care of our American friends;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-023.wav|We have to take care of our families;
./myfolder/VOICE/05-024.wav|Thank you god bless you and God bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-001.wav|As a candidate for President I promised that my Administration would fight every day for American Workers;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-002.wav|Years of unfair trade have hammered American families and plundered American wealth;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-003.wav|It's been absolutely terrible for our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-004.wav|We turned a blind eye while other nations targeted our industries and ransacked our factories;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-005.wav|They took advantage of our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-006.wav|They took advantage of our people;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-007.wav|Over the last two decades the United States racked up twelve point five trillion-dollar trade deficits in goods and watched nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs disappear or go to other countries;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-008.wav|We financed the rise of other countries at the expense of our own middle-class people;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-009.wav|Yet our leaders in Washington did absolutely nothing;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-010.wav|They allowed other countries to cheat, to break the rules and to steal our jobs with impunity;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-011.wav|Politicians responded to economic aggression with economic surrender Not anymore - it's not going to happen;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-012.wav|We're standing up for our families our factory workers and our way of life;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-013.wav|My Administration hears your voice - and has your back;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-014.wav|After a thorough investigation my Administration documented China's unfair trade practices - including forced technology transfers;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-015.wav|As a result of this investigation we're taking concrete actions to stop this abuse;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-016.wav|including proposing tariffs on select imports designed to save our industries for the future;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-017.wav|We have no other choice;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-018.wav|We'll get along with China - they'll be friends of ours, but they just can't take advantage of us any longer;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-019.wav|We will have a great relationship with China - but it will be a fair relationship not like it was;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-020.wav|We will also no longer tolerate unfair and non-reciprocal trading practices - not only with China, but with anyone;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-021.wav|And my Administration will use all available authorities to protect our great farmers;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-022.wav|We love our farmers, we're going to take care of our farmers;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-023.wav|We want fair and reciprocal trade - where countries open their markets in equal measure, and all sides play by the rules;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-024.wav|And that hasn't been happening in the past;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-025.wav|What we won't tolerate are one-sided deals where we open our markets while other countries close theirs;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-026.wav|Only by standing up for ourselves can we end the abuse, restore our prosperity, and reclaim our economic independence;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-027.wav|We're going to make America wealthy again, not only great again;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-028.wav|Thank you God bless you;
./myfolder/VOICE/06-029.wav|And God bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-001.wav|My fellow Americans, the federal government is charged with the sacred duties of protecting our nation supporting our Constitution, and defending our borders;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-002.wav|We also have to ensure the equal application of our laws in all fifty states;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-003.wav|Last year politicians in California violated the Constitution by nullifying federal law and declaring their state to be a sanctuary from federal immigration enforcement;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-004.wav|A border-free zone with thousands of criminal aliens can roam free, a very, very dangerous situation. Unacceptable to everyone;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-005.wav|Their actions not only imperil the security of the people of California, but the security of the entire nation;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-006.wav|California's sanctuary bill should be called The Jailbreak Bill, because that's exactly what it is;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-007.wav|They force the release of dangerous criminal aliens from prisons and jails including drug traffickers and dealers responsible for the deaths of countless Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-008.wav|It's gotten totally out of control;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-009.wav|We can't allow it to go on;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-010.wav|California's law also increases our vulnerability to terrorism by keeping lifesaving information from federal authorities;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-011.wav|The relationship is ridiculous;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-012.wav|It forces law enforcement not to work together;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-013.wav|Last week the citizens of Orange County California bravely resisted the open borders politicians, in Sacramento;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-014.wav|The orange County Board of Supervisors courageously voted to join the administration's lawsuit to stop these dangerous and unconstitutional actions;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-015.wav|All across California and all over America everyday citizens are taking a stand to protect their families, protect their borders, and protect their country;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-016.wav|Every citizen has the right to be protected by federal law, and when politicians in California break those laws, they violate the constitutional rights of their citizens;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-017.wav|My message to communities under siege from drugs and gangs and violence is, You can stop this, and you can stop it cold;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-018.wav|Partner with the federal government so we can help to remove these threats from your communities and restore peace to our streets;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-019.wav|I'm also calling on Congress to immediately close the deadly border security loopholes, that endanger our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-020.wav|All over our country, we're living with laws that don't work. Congress has to change them;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-021.wav|Democrats in Congress are doing everything in their power to undermine immigration enforcement and encourage illegal immigration;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-022.wav|Their policies are putting all of America at risk;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-023.wav|It is so bad, it's hard to believe what they're doing and why they're doing it;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-025.wav|The Democrats are not doing what's right for our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-026.wav|I will not rest until we have secured our borders and restored the rule of law;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-027.wav|We will win, and we will soon;
./myfolder/VOICE/07-028.wav|It's happening;
./myfolder/VOICE/08-002.wav|During the sacred holiday of Passover, Jewish families around the world give thanks to God for liberating the Jewish people from bondage in Egypt and delivering them to the Promised Land of Israel;
./myfolder/VOICE/08-003.wav|For Christians we remember the suffering and death of God's only son, and his glorious resurrection, on the third day;
./myfolder/VOICE/08-004.wav|On Easter Sunday we proclaim with joy, Christ is risen;
./myfolder/VOICE/08-005.wav|Both of these sacred celebrations remind us that God's love redeems the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/08-006.wav|Almost three thousand years ago the prophet Isiah wrote, Darkness covers the Earth, but the Lord rises upon you, and his glory appears over you, for the Lord will be your everlasting light;
./myfolder/VOICE/08-007.wav|In America we look to the light of God to guide our steps, we trust in the power of the Almighty for wisdom and strength, and we praise our heavenly Father for blessings of freedom;
./myfolder/VOICE/08-008.wav|and the gift of eternal life;
./myfolder/VOICE/08-009.wav|Happy Passover, Happy Easter, thank you God bless you, and God bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-001.wav|My fellow Americans, everyday an average of one hundred sixteen Americans die from an opioid related overdose;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-002.wav|This is a national crisis that demands immediate action;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-003.wav|That is why last week I traveled to New Hampshire, to announce the steps my administration is taking to combat this deadly epidemic;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-004.wav|Our plan has three major parts;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-005.wav|reducing drug demand by focusing on prevention, so people don't get addicted in the first place;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-006.wav|Reducing drug supply including getting tough on traffickers and dealers;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-007.wav|And when I say tough I'm talking about really tough because it's the only language they understand;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-008.wav|Increasing drug treatment to get lifesaving help to those who really need it;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-009.wav|But if our brave federal agents are going to be successful in stopping this deadly epidemic, then we much stop lawless sanctuary cities;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-010.wav|Sanctuary cities release thousands of dangerous criminal aliens into our communities, including drug traffickers, drug dealers, and vicious gang members;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-011.wav|In fact several of the criminal aliens who got away in Oakland, after the mayor helped the evade capture, have already committed new crimes;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-012.wav|Crimes that could have been easily prevented if not for Oakland's dangerous sanctuary policies;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-013.wav|It is no coincidence that six of the biggest heroin markets in the United States are sanctuary cities;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-014.wav|More than forty percent of heroin coming across the southern border is transported through California, a sanctuary state;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-015.wav|Drug cartels have transformed sanctuary cities like Denver, Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York into major distribution centers;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-016.wav|because the criminal aliens in the drug trade know that local politicians will help them evade authorities;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-017.wav|Sanctuary cities put innocent Americans at the mercy of hardened criminals and heartless drug dealers;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-018.wav|These are bad people;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-019.wav|We want our cities to be safe havens for Americans, not criminal aliens;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-020.wav|It is time for Congress to cut off funds for sanctuary cities and to close the loopholes that allowed drugs and criminals to violate our borders;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-021.wav|We're going to stop the flow of deadly drugs, we're going to get help to those who need it, and we are going to end the scourge of addiction in America;
./myfolder/VOICE/09-022.wav|Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-001.wav|My Fellow Americans, protecting the safety and well-being of American Citizens is my highest duty as President;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-002.wav|Yet lawless sanctuary jurisdictions are nullifying federal law;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-003.wav|obstructing immigration enforcement and releasing thousands of criminal aliens into US communities to prey on innocent victims;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-004.wav|It's absolutely terrible;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-005.wav|For example in recent days San Francisco officials denied ICE's request to turn over a criminal alien with a prior conviction for battery and a charge for driving under the influence;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-006.wav|In another city in California local law enforcement recently denied ICE's request to turn over a criminal alien convicted of Sexual Battery who had a history of domestic violence;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-007.wav|A truly violent person;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-008.wav|And last week the mayor of Oakland warned criminal aliens of a coming ICE enforcement action - giving them time to scatter and hide from authorities;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-009.wav|The mayor's conduct directly threatened the safety of federal immigration officers and the law-abiding Americans in her community;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-010.wav|The State of California is sheltering dangerous criminals in a brazen and lawless attack on our Constitutional system of government;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-011.wav|Every state in our Union is subject to the laws and Constitution of the United States including California;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-012.wav|Yet California's leaders are in open defiance of federal law;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-013.wav|They don't care about crime;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-014.wav|They don't care about death and killings;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-015.wav|They don't care about robberies;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-016.wav|They don't care about the kind of things that you and I care about;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-017.wav|In other recent cases, New York authorities released illegal aliens who were previously charged with assault, criminal possession of a weapon, possession of poisonous drugs, and strangling a person;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-018.wav|in each case, New York officials had refused to turn these dangerous illegal aliens over to ICE or notify ICE about their release with enough time for them to be safely arrested;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-019.wav|Just this week the city of Denver refused ICE's request, to turn over a criminal illegal alien, charged with vehicular homicide for killing another driver in a horrific hit-and-run;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-020.wav|Sanctuary jurisdictions are the best friend of smugglers, gang members, drug dealers, human traffickers, killers, and other violent offenders;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-021.wav|We want our cities to be sanctuaries for Americans, not safe havens for criminals;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-022.wav|That is why I am calling on Congress to block funds for jurisdictions that shield dangerous criminals;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-023.wav|It is time to end the bloodshed brought about by reckless sanctuary policies - and it is time to save American lives and American cities;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-024.wav|Thank you;
./myfolder/VOICE/10-026.wav|And God bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-001.wav|My fellow Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-002.wav|this week prosecutors, law enforcement officers, homeland security officials;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-003.wav|and lawmakers joined me at the White House to address;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-004.wav|a very vicious threat to our communities;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-005.wav|the savage gang MS thirteen;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-006.wav|Glaring loopholes in our laws have allowed criminals and gang members to break into our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-007.wav|For example, under current law, unaccompanied alien minors at the border are released into American communities no matter where;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-008.wav|no matter how;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-009.wav|it's so easy for them because the laws are bad, and they have to be changed;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-010.wav|This loophole is easily exploited by MS thirteen;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-011.wav|which now operates in at least forty states;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-012.wav|In addition to MS thirteen, many other gangs are breaking into our country routinely because our laws are so weak, so sad, so pathetic;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-013.wav|At this week's roundtable we learned the story of one family right here in Washington, D.C. that hosted a person in their home, who then began to recruit their young son to MS thirteen;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-014.wav|When the boy's mother tried to stop it, the gang member shot her in the head, blinding her for life;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-015.wav|She's lucky she lived, but she's paying a very big price;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-016.wav|During my State of the Union I called on Congress to immediately close dangerous loopholes in federal law;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-017.wav|that have endangered our communities and imposed enormous burdens on U.S. taxpayers;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-018.wav|My Administration has identified three major priorities;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-019.wav|for creating a safe;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-020.wav|modern and lawful immigration system;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-021.wav|fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-022.wav|Chain migration is a disaster and very unfair to our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-023.wav|The visa lottery is something that should have never been allowed in the first place;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-024.wav|People enter a lottery to come into our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-025.wav|What kind of a system is that;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-026.wav|It is time for Congress to act and to protect Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-027.wav|Every member of Congress should choose the side of law enforcement, and the side of the American People;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-028.wav|That's the way it has to be;
./myfolder/VOICE/11-029.wav|Thank you;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-001.wav|I have a dream;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-002.wav|Martin Luther King Jr.'s immortal words;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-003.wav|delivered on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, have inspired Americans of all backgrounds since they were spoken on that historic day;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-004.wav|in nineteen sixty-three;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-005.wav|Dr. King's dream is our dream;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-006.wav|It is the American dream;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-007.wav|It's the promise stitched into the fabric of our nation, etched into the hearts of our people, and written into the soul of humankind;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-008.wav|It is the dream of the world where people are judged by who they are, not how they look or where they come from;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-009.wav|It is the dream of a nation that offers life of dignity and hope to every American;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-010.wav|regardless of color or creed;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-011.wav|It is the dream of a nation, faithful to its founding principles that we are all created equal;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-012.wav|This sacred principle was the cause for which Dr. King and so many other historic Americans sacrificed in places like Selma, Birmingham, Montgomery, and Memphis;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-013.wav|They were heroes who led our nation forward toward a future that is more just and more free;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-014.wav|Fifty years ago this spring, Dr. King was cruelly taken from this world;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-015.wav|by assassin's bullet;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-016.wav|but the promise he fought for;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-017.wav|could never be taken away. His words, his deeds, they live on forever;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-018.wav|And the cause for which he gave his life only gained strength, and force and power, with the passage of time;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-019.wav|Last week I was so pleased to be joined by Dr. King's niece, Alveda;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-020.wav|as I signed into law the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park Act;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-021.wav|This important legislation, will ensure that the beautiful historic park continues to tell Dr. King's story;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-022.wav|for generations to come;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-023.wav|On this cherished day we honor the memory of Reverend King, and we rededicate ourselves, to a glorious future;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-024.wav|where every American from every walk of life;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-025.wav|can live free from fear, liberated from hatred, and uplifted by boundless love for their fellow citizens;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-026.wav|I ask every citizen to join me in remembering this great American hero, and to carry on his legacy of justice, equality and freedom;
./myfolder/VOICE/12-027.wav|God bless the memory of Reverend King, and God bless the United States of America;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-001.wav|My fellow Americans, as we approach the final days of the year, it is truly incredible to think of how much we have accomplished on our journey together;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-002.wav|Since the election, we have created more than two million jobs for hard working, wonderful families and wonderful Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-003.wav|Unemployment is at a seventeen-year low, the stock market is at an all-time high, and continues to go up up up;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-004.wav|We want to keep it going;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-005.wav|We've liberated the American economy from the Washington overreach cutting twenty-two regulations for every one new regulation, the most in the history of our country by far;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-006.wav|And just last week we delivered a big beautiful Christmas present to the American people;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-007.wav|Congress passed massive tax cuts for millions of working American families and small businesses and large businesses;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-008.wav|And those large businesses in particular, coupled with others, are going to create jobs jobs jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-009.wav|Our tax plan is focused on the middle class including a near doubling of the standard deduction and a huge increase in the child tax credit;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-010.wav|A typical family of four, earning seventy five thousand dollars will see their tax bill cut in half;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-011.wav|One half of what you were paying;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-012.wav|And Americans will begin seeing these tax cuts in their paychecks starting in February;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-013.wav|In addition, our border is now strong;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-014.wav|we'll be building the wall;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-015.wav|your Second Amendment is safe, we're unlocking America's vast energy resources;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-016.wav|we've restored enforcement of immigration laws, taken the fight right to MS thirteen and getting them out of the country;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-017.wav|and we are now working with Congress to end chain migration and the Visa lottery program which is terrible and brings in people that we don't want in our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-018.wav|I'm very proud of the choice of Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-019.wav|and we are re-shaping the entire Judiciary for many decades to come;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-020.wav|Congress has authorized funding for our military at near record levels, so that we can rebuild our full military might after years of dangerous cuts and depletion of our military;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-021.wav|We've made historic strides in the fight against the murderous terror group known as ISIS;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-022.wav|Today the coalition to defeat ISIS has recaptured nearly one hundred percent of the territory once held by these vile terrorists in Iraq and Syria;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-023.wav|We are rebuilding our nation, rebuilding our confidence, and rebuilding our standing in the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-024.wav|Today the entire world can see that America is coming back and coming back strong;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-025.wav|The American people are excited about the future and the incredible possibilities that await all of us;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-026.wav|Optimism is everywhere, enthusiasm is booming, and the thrilling American adventure has never looked brighter;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-027.wav|We are facing old challenges with new solutions and we are seizing new opportunities with brimming confidence and boundless resolve;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-028.wav|Because of you your patriotism, your devotion, your love for your family, we will be able to pass on the blessings of American liberty and prosperity to our children and our grandchildren;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-029.wav|Together we are protecting our magnificent heritage and reaching for glorious destiny;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-030.wav|Finally Melania and I want to wish every American a very happy New Year;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-031.wav|Our country is great, our country is strong;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-032.wav|we're doing things that nobody thought possible;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-033.wav|Thank you for giving me the opportunity to help;
./myfolder/VOICE/13-034.wav|God bless you, and God bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-001.wav|My Fellow Americans, This week I signed the National Defense Authorization Act - a historic step forward to rebuild our military;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-002.wav|Now, it is critical for Congress to pass the Clean Government Appropriations Bill that fully funds our Military Needs;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-003.wav|We must not play politics with our troops - we should pass a clean funding bill and leave the politics aside;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-004.wav|We must protect our nation;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-005.wav|I'd also like to take a moment today to discuss our immigration system, and how we can reform it to make it work for everyday Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-006.wav|Our current immigration system helps special interests, but hurts American workers, taxpayers and national security;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-007.wav|For decades now U.S. immigration rules have been based on an outdated system known as Chain Migration;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-008.wav|Under chain migration foreign nationals can come to the United States and bring in unlimited numbers of foreign relatives;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-009.wav|A single immigrant can begin a chain that could ultimately bring in dozens of increasingly distant relations;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-010.wav|Because these individuals are admitted solely on the basis of family ties - not skill or not merit - most of this immigration is lower-skilled, putting great strain on federal welfare;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-011.wav|And because there is no real selection criteria, the current system is totally incompatible with national security;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-012.wav|This week a terrorist exploded a pipe bomb on a busy subway passage during rush hour in New York City, injuring innocent Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-013.wav|This individual arrived through chain migration;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-014.wav|In October another terrorist drove a truck into pedestrians, and cyclists in New York City, killing eight people and wounding many others;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-015.wav|That individual came through a visa lottery;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-016.wav|It is time to create a merit-based immigration system that makes sense for a modern economy - selecting new arrivals based on their ability to support themselves financially and to make positive contributions to U.S society;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-017.wav|Base it on love of our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-018.wav|We want people that come in that can love our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-019.wav|This process begins with Congress passing a bill to end chain migration and also end the visa lottery;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-020.wav|I have called on Congress to do exactly that;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-021.wav|Ending chain migration and also ending the visa lottery will allow us to have commonsense immigration rules that promote assimilation and wage growth;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-022.wav|It also promotes, most importantly, safety;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-023.wav|It'll help Americans both old and new to thrive flourish and prosper;
./myfolder/VOICE/14-024.wav|Thank you, and God Bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-001.wav|Help me Dad;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-002.wav|Those were the last words spoken by Kate Steinle as she lay dying on a San Francisco pier - a precious young American woman killed in the prime of her life;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-003.wav|Kate's death is a tragedy that was entirely preventable;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-004.wav|She was shot by an illegal alien and a seven time convicted felon who had been deported five times - but he was free to harm an innocent American because our leaders refused to protect our border, and because San Francisco is a Sanctuary City;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-005.wav|In Sanctuary States and Cities, innocent Americans are at the mercy of criminal aliens because state and local officials defy federal authorities and obstruct the enforcement of our immigration laws;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-006.wav|Last week in a final injustice, Kate's killer was acquitted on all of the most serious charges - yet one more why reason Americans are so upset by Sanctuary Cities and open border politicians;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-007.wav|who shield criminal aliens from federal law enforcement and all of the problems involved with the whole concept of a sanctuary city;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-009.wav|We mourn for all of the American Families of all backgrounds who will have any empty seat at Christmas this year, because our immigration laws were not enforced;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-010.wav|No American should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-011.wav|Our cities should be Sanctuaries for Americans not for criminal aliens;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-012.wav|Unfortunately Democrats in Congress not only oppose our efforts to stop illegal immigration and crack down on Sanctuary Cities;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-013.wav|now they are demanding amnesty as a condition for funding the government, holding troop funding hostage and putting our national security at risk;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-014.wav|We cannot allow it;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-015.wav|Every Senator and Congressman will have to make a choice: do they want to protect American citizens or do they want to protect criminal aliens;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-016.wav|Reasonable people can disagree on many things but there can be no disagreement, that the first duty of government is to serve protect and defend American Citizens;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-017.wav|People can have different views on the technical details of budget policy or transportation, but no one who serves in elected office should disagree that our highest priority must be the safety and well-being of our nation's citizens;
./myfolder/VOICE/15-018.wav|Thank you;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-001.wav|My fellow Americans, Melania and I would like to wish a blessed and joyful Thanksgiving;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-002.wav|Nearly four hundred years ago the pilgrims gathered with Native Americans to give thanks to their first harvest;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-003.wav|Just over a year before in September, of sixteen twenty the pilgrims set sail on the Mayflower to settle in new land where they could live and worship freely;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-004.wav|They came to this continent with few resources, but rich in faith, courage and dreams;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-005.wav|They endured a treacherous voyage across the ocean and long days inside the ship's cabin as storms raged wild;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-006.wav|Then when the pilgrims arrived at Plymouth, their first act, was to pray;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-007.wav|Soon they persevered through the months of bitter winter with the hep of Squanto and the Wampanoag Tribe;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-008.wav|They survived and began to build a new home for their families;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-009.wav|On their first Thanksgiving they came together to rejoice after their harvest and praised God for his provision;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-010.wav|Since then Americans have always remembered the blessings of freedom and the glory of God;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-011.wav|In his first year as president George Washington proclaimed a day of public thanks giving and prayer;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-012.wav|He asked all citizens to unite in sincere and humble thanks for God's providence and the founding our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-013.wav|And in the midst of the Civil War, President Lincoln made the last Thursday in November a national holiday;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-014.wav|He called on Americans to come together with one heart and one voice to thank God for his gracious gifts and to ask him to heal the wounds of the nation and to restore it;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-015.wav|Today we give thanks for all of the pilgrims pioneers and patriots who have gone before us and for all those warriors who have kept us safe and free;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-016.wav|This week we know that thousands of men and women in uniform won't be able to come home for Thanksgiving;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-017.wav|They are standing watch around the world facing down our enemies and defending our great American flag;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-018.wav|We're eternally grateful for their courage, heroism and sacrifice;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-019.wav|We also thank Americans at home who serve their fellow Americans in need of a helping hand;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-020.wav|Families who care for the sick, bring food to the hungry and provide a loving home to children across the country;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-021.wav|This year in the face of painful hardships, we have seen the incredible strength of the American spirit;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-022.wav|Neighbors helping neighbors strangers helping strangers and citizens reaching out for those in need;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-023.wav|We pray for the Americans impacted by the devastating storms and wildfires that struck our nation, we mourn for the victims of the horrible shootings that stole so many innocent lives;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-024.wav|and we thank God for the police firefighters, paramedics and rescue workers who put themselves in harms way to save others;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-025.wav|The people of this nation come from all different backgrounds, but we are all one people and one American family;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-026.wav|We all share the same heart, the same home, and the same glorious destiny and we are all bound together by the common bonds of love loyalty and affection that make our country into a wonderful home;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-027.wav|Together we give thanks to the loved ones who grace our lives and for the heroes who protect our nation and we ask for God's continued blessings on this magnificent land;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-028.wav|Our country is doing very well, our stock market has hit a new all-time high, unemployment is at a seventeen-year low, we've created five and a half trillion worth of values;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-029.wav|we are doing something very special, people are feeling it, the enthusiasm in this country has never been higher;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-030.wav|We're very very happy on this Thanksgiving Day;
./myfolder/VOICE/17-031.wav|Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-001.wav|My fellow Americans, on Wednesday I traveled to Las Vegas to visit with the victims of the horrific shooting, speak with their families and thank the brave citizens, first responders and medical personnel who saved so many lives;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-002.wav|We struggled to grasp the evil that occurred on Sunday evening, when a murderer shot into a crowd of more than twenty thousand people;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-003.wav|Men women and children were gathered to enjoy a concert, they never imagined it would become the worst day of their lives;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-004.wav|But in the wake of such shock and horror it was a matter of seconds before the goodness of the human spirit broke through;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-005.wav|When the shooting began a mother laid on top of her daughter to shield her from gunfire;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-006.wav|A husband died to protect his beloved wife;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-007.wav|Strangers rescued strangers;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-008.wav|Police officers and first responders rushed into danger;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-009.wav|When the worst of humanity strikes the best of humanity responds;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-010.wav|The men and women who risk their lives to save their fellow citizens give proof to the words of this scripture;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-011.wav|The light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-012.wav|Americans defied death and hatred with love and courage;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-013.wav|This week our nation remembers all the wonderful people we have lost and all of the grace they brought into our lives and our communities;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-014.wav|Among the fallen were young students full of limitless potential;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-015.wav|Law-enforcement personnel, a nurse, teachers dedicated to our children's future and many others;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-016.wav|They were mothers fathers sisters and brothers, they were husbands and wives and sons and daughters, they will be dearly missed and they will never be forgotten;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-017.wav|To all those who lost a loved one we cannot imagine your pain or erase your sorrow;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-018.wav|Our hearts grieve for you;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-019.wav|We stand with you now and every day after and we pray that God may carry you through the anguish and sorrow;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-020.wav|We can never fill the void of those who perished, but we pledge to honor them by living as they would have wished, with lives full of purpose with hearts full of love and with hope for a better tomorrow;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-021.wav|May God comfort the brokenhearted and may God bless the United States of America;
./myfolder/VOICE/18-022.wav|Thank you;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-001.wav|My Fellow Americans, All American hearts are united with the people of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands who have faced terrible devastation in the wake of two catastrophic hurricane;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-002.wav|We are working night and day in cooperation with territorial and local authorities to assist those in need, to help save and sustain lives and to begin the long recovery and rebuilding effort;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-003.wav|Our commitment to those affected is this: We are with you, we will stay with you and we will come back stronger than ever;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-004.wav|We are sending tremendous amounts of supplies, tremendous amounts of food and water and we are sending great people to help;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-005.wav|I know that it's been devastating I know your police force and everything else has been absolutely hurt, but we're sending people to help, and it's getting better on a daily basis;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-006.wav|This week I traveled to Indiana to announce historic tax reform, for the American people;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-007.wav|It is based on four key ideas;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-009.wav|People will pay a lot less money;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-010.wav|Single individuals will not be taxed on the first twelve thousand dollars of income earned;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-011.wav|And a married couple will pay zero taxes on their first twenty-four thousand dollars of income;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-012.wav|After that taxable income will be subject to just three tax rates - twelve, twenty-five and thirty-five, it use to be seven;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-013.wav|We will also expand the child tax credit, eliminate the credit's marriage penalty, and provide a new five-hundred dollar tax credit for elder-care and other adult dependents;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-014.wav|This is the real and lasting tax relief that everyday Americans badly need and truly deserve;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-015.wav|This is what working Americans have been after;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-016.wav|Second, our framework will make the tax code simple fair and easy to understand;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-017.wav|Under our plan, the vast majority of families will be able to file their taxes on a single sheet of paper;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-018.wav|As part of simplification, we are also getting rid of taxes that threaten to put family businesses and American farmers out of business;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-019.wav|Julie Ellingson is a fourth generation cattle rancher in Bismarck, North Dakota;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-020.wav|Julie and her family's legacy of hard work should not be taken away when she dies - we will eliminate the Death Tax and keep her American Dream alive;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-021.wav|Most importantly her family will long remember and they'll be working hard for many many years on their farm;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-022.wav|Third, we are going to restore America's competitive edge so that American businesses and workers can win again;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-023.wav|We will cut the corporate rate below the average of our foreign competitors - and we will reduce the top marginal income tax rate on small and mid-sized businesses to the lowest in more than eighty years;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-024.wav|It's so important because our companies are leaving our shores and when they leave, they let go of the workers;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-025.wav|And then they make their product and they send it back into our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-026.wav|We don't tax them, we don't do anything Those days are over;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-027.wav|We now have a competitive tax where our companies won't be leaving;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-028.wav|Believe me, it won't be happening like it has it's going to be a big difference;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-029.wav|Finally, our framework encourages corporations to bring back trillions of dollars in wealth parked overseas, and stops punishing companies for keeping their headquarters in the United States;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-030.wav|That's actually what's happening;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-031.wav|Companies that stay in our country are being punished by our tax code;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-032.wav|This will switch our current offshoring model - a tax system that drives jobs to other countries - to a new American Model;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-033.wav|Under this plan we want our companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers and to help rebuild American cities and towns;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-034.wav|This is a once in a generation opportunity to pass tax reform and to restore our jobs, our wealth, and our great American Dreams;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-035.wav|We will be able to dream again and those dreams will be met;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-036.wav|Now it is time-finally for Congress to deliver;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-037.wav|The problem we have is the democrats don't want to cut your taxes, they want to actually raise your taxes, and raise them very substantially;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-038.wav|We can't afford to do that as a country that's why our jobs are leaving, that's why you don' t have enough left in your pay check;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-039.wav|We want to cut taxes and it's going to be the biggest tax cut in the history of our Country;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-040.wav|Thank you;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-041.wav|God Bless You;
./myfolder/VOICE/19-042.wav|And God Bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-001.wav|My fellow Americans, The American Family has always been the heart of our great nation;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-002.wav|In homes across this country families teach their children to work hard, to love each other, and to make the most of their talents in pursuit of their dreams;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-003.wav|Yet for too long American families have been hurt by Washington's policies that put the interests of other countries before the interests of our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-004.wav|That's why in my Administration we are pursuing tax cuts and reform, that create jobs in America for American workers not foreign workers but, American workers;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-005.wav|Here are my four principles for tax reform: First, we are going to make the tax code simple and fair, so that families can spend more time with their children, and less time wading through pages of paperwork;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-006.wav|A staggering ninety-four percent of families use professional help, to do their taxes - and that's not fair, it's not right;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-007.wav|That's why under our plan ninety-five percent of Americans will be able to file their tax return on a single page without keeping receipts, tracking paperwork, or filling out extra schedules;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-008.wav|Second we are going to cut taxes for the middle class, so that hardworking Americans can finally save more for their future;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-009.wav|We want to help families keep more of what they earn - and to be able to afford the costs of raising a family;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-010.wav|Our tax code should recognize that the most important investment we can make is in our children;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-011.wav|Third we are going to restore America's competitive edge by making our tax system more attractive for investment and job creation;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-012.wav|Our business tax rate is the highest in the world - pushing jobs to foreign countries;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-013.wav|That's not what we want, that's not what I've been talking about all these years - I've been talking about the exact opposite;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-014.wav|We need to bring down our tax rate so we can create jobs, wealth and opportunity right here in the United States of America, so we can bring our jobs back and bring our businesses back;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-015.wav|We want tax reform that puts America First;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-016.wav|We want tax reform that makes America great again;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-017.wav|Finally we are going to bring back trillions of dollars in wealth parked overseas so that it can be invested in our country where it belongs;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-018.wav|We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform our tax code and pave the way to unprecedented prosperity;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-019.wav|By doing what we're doing, you will see results like you've never seen before;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-020.wav|It will be the largest tax cut in our country's history;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-021.wav|I am asking members in both parties to come together, to put aside partisan differences and to pass historic tax reform and tax cuts for the great citizens of our nation;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-022.wav|That's how we will all succeed and thrive together - as one team one people, and one American Family;
./myfolder/VOICE/20-023.wav|Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-001.wav|My fellow Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-002.wav|I would like to begin by continuing to send our prayers to all of those affected by hurricanes Harvey and Irma;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-003.wav|From Texas to Louisiana to Florida, Alabama, South Carolina the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, we are coordinating closely with local authorities to help everyone impacted by these catastrophic storms;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-004.wav|When Americans are in need America pulls together and we will not rest until everyone's safe sound and secure we will be there tomorrow and the day after as we work to respond to recover and rebuild;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-005.wav|When Americans are united no force on earth can break us apart;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-006.wav|This week the United States celebrates the two hundred and thirtieth anniversary of the signing of our remarkable Constitution;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-007.wav|The fifty-five delegates to the grand convention in Philadelphia met from May to September of seventeen eighty-seven they gave us an incredible gift a vision of a sovereign and self-governing people to control their own affairs;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-008.wav|And they gave us a constitutional system that protected our liberties by enshrining the rule of law;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-009.wav|Patriots like Washington Madison Hamilton Franklin and so many others had already achieved immortality through their victory and the revolution;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-010.wav|but soon after these extraordinary leaders faced another task unlike any other, the task of building a brand new nation;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-011.wav|So they designed a system of government rooted in common laws history and traditions that would secure the liberty equality and rights they had fought for and fought to defend in the American Revolution;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-012.wav|The framers of our Constitution triumphantly declared to whom the government of the United States belonged, it was we the people, these three beautiful words are among the most important ideas in our nation's history;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-013.wav|the idea that governments power is vested in the nation's citizens the people to whom we owe our ultimate and sacred allegiance;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-014.wav|Our soldiers fight and died to protect our citizens and our government is forever duty-bound to safeguard their sovereignty and their freedom;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-015.wav|For two hundred and thirty years we have governed ourselves and planned our own destiny, guarded all the way by the Constitution of the United States;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-016.wav|on this Sunday, Constitution day, let us recommit ourselves to our founding principles and rededicate ourselves to our glorious heritage;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-017.wav|We have inherited a birthright of freedom, we must defend it dearly, protected jealously, and promoted proudly, as one nation under God;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-018.wav|We must rise to the task of self-governance, proved worthy of the sacrifices made to carve out this magnificent nation and we must give our loyalty to our Republic and its citizens in all that we do;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-019.wav|so let us pledge allegiance to our flag devote our hearts to our country and demonstrate our love for one another, as Americans as Patriots and as the children of God;
./myfolder/VOICE/21-020.wav|Thank you;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-001.wav|My fellow Americans, As Hurricane Irma approaches my Administration is working closely with our state and local partners to help save lives, protect families, and assist those in need;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-002.wav|This is a storm of absolutely historic destructive potential;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-003.wav|I ask everyone in the storm's path, to be vigilant and to heed all recommendations from government officials and law enforcement;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-004.wav|Nothing is more important than the safety and security of our people;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-005.wav|We are doing everything we can to help with disaster preparations and, when the time comes, we will restore, recover and rebuild together as Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-006.wav|In times such as these we see the strength and the resolve of the American Spirit - and we see the kindness and courage of our people;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-007.wav|With gratitude for our first responders and prayers for those in the storm's path, America stands united - and I mean totally united;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-008.wav|From Texas to Louisiana, from Florida to Puerto Rico, and always the US Virgin Islands, and everywhere in between that has been affected by these terrible storms: we will endure and come back stronger than ever before;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-009.wav|Earlier this week I visited the hardworking citizens of North Dakota to promote our vision for tax cuts and tax reform that will create opportunity and prosperity for millions and millions of Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-010.wav|As President, I am committed to pursuing an economic policy that lifts up all of our citizens, provides hope for all of our communities, and generates wealth for everyday hardworking people and it's about time;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-011.wav|Since January we've already created one point two million jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-012.wav|Unemployment is near a sixteen-year low;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-013.wav|Wages are rising;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-014.wav|But for our economy to truly take off like it should, we must cut taxes and reform our badly-broken tax system;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-015.wav|Our current burdensome tax code is a massive lead weight against the American economy;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-016.wav|It costs us millions of jobs, trillions of dollars and billions and billions of hours wasted on paperwork and compliance;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-017.wav|My Administration is working closely with Congress to develop a plan that will deliver more jobs, higher pay, and lower taxes for businesses of all sizes and most importantly for Middle Class families all across America;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-018.wav|First, we are going to make filing taxes as simple as possible;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-019.wav|If you're like most Americans under our plan you will file your taxes on a single page;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-020.wav|What a difference that will make - and you won't need to keep endless receipts and paperwork;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-021.wav|We are freeing you from the horrible tax maze;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-022.wav|Secondly, we will cut taxes for Middle Class families;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-023.wav|We want you to keep more of your hard earned money;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-024.wav|This way, you could spend it, you could save it you could do whatever you want;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-025.wav|Third, we will restore our competitive edge so we can create more jobs and higher wages for the American worker;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-026.wav|Today we have the highest business tax rate anywhere in the developed world - sixty percent higher on average than our major foreign competitors;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-027.wav|It is a crushing tax on every product Made in America, and it encourages American businesses to ship jobs and factories overseas - something that I have been fighting long and hard and we are making tremendous head way Believe me;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-028.wav|they are starting to move back to our country and the jobs are coming with them;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-029.wav|We are going to cut taxes on American Industry so we can create more business in our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-030.wav|We want our companies to hire and grow in America, to raise wages for American workers and to help rebuild our American cities and towns;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-031.wav|Finally we will make it easier for companies to bring back trillions of dollars that they are now keeping overseas;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-032.wav|And the reason is the tax is too high and the bureaucracy is too great;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-033.wav|It is so complicated for them to bring back their money that they say let's just leave it over here, we won't bring it back to the United States;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-034.wav|Terrible situation;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-035.wav|We are going to take care of it;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-036.wav|But this money, should be brought back to American soil, where it can be invested in new factories and brand new beautiful jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-037.wav|Our plan is pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-family, and pro-American;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-038.wav|This is our chance to give American workers a level playing field, to end the rigged system that lets special interests win at the expense of the middle class, and to reestablish our economic dominance for generations to come;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-039.wav|That is how we all succeed and grow together - as one team, one people and one American family;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-040.wav|Frankly, that is how we Make America Great Again;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-041.wav|Thank you;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-042.wav|God bless you;
./myfolder/VOICE/22-043.wav|And God bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-001.wav|My fellow Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-002.wav|the heartbreaking devastation and suffering caused by Hurricane Harvey has profoundly affected our entire nation;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-003.wav|Many homes and communities have been destroyed;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-004.wav|Many lives have been upended and tragically some have lost their lives in this catastrophic storm;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-005.wav|We pray for the victims and their families and all of those who have been displaced from their homes;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-006.wav|At this very moment heroic efforts continue to keep safe those threatened by this natural disaster;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-007.wav|I want to say a special word of thanks to our amazing first responders our police and law enforcement officers, firefighters, Coast Guard, National Guard, EMS, doctors, nurses, hospital workers and volunteers;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-008.wav|who have traveled from all across the country;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-009.wav|Thousands of people have come together prevent loss of life and ensure safety and we are incredibly grateful for their courage their professionalism and their sacrifice;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-010.wav|They are an inspiration to all of us;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-011.wav|To the people affected by Hurricane Harvey;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-012.wav|We are with you every single step of the way;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-013.wav|we will help you recover we will help you rebuild we will support you today tomorrow and the day after;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-014.wav|We've been working closely with local authorities and I remain in close communication with Governor Abbott of Texas and Governor Edwards of Louisiana;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-015.wav|at the request of Governor Abbott I declared a major disaster to the state of Texas to ensure that federal aid is available for state and local recovery efforts;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-016.wav|I also approved a disaster declaration for Louisiana;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-017.wav|organizations like the Red Cross the Salvation Army and faith-based organizations are actively assisting on the ground and they are doing a fantastic job;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-018.wav|I want to recognize the millions of citizens across the country who are contributing in every way they can with their time their resources and their prayers;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-019.wav|when one part of America hurts we all hurt;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-020.wav|when we see neighbors in need we rushed to their aid we don't ask their names or where they're from;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-021.wav|we help our fellow Americans every single time;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-022.wav|This is the spirit of America it's exactly what I saw while in Texas this week a spirit of love, determination and resolve a spirit that even when wounded never gives up never gives in never loses hope;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-023.wav|we just keep fighting we just keep pushing on for the people we love and for the nation we call home;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-024.wav|All American hearts with the people of Texas and Louisiana we mourn and pray and struggle through the hardships together we know that a long and difficult path lies ahead to get our neighbors back in their homes and on their feet;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-025.wav|but we also know that we are stronger than the obstacles in our path;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-026.wav|arm and arm we will strive we will endure and we will emerge stronger than ever before;
./myfolder/VOICE/23-027.wav|Thank you, God bless you and God bless the United of America;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-001.wav|My fellow Americans, I had the profound honor this week of addressing American troops at Fort Meyer, and speaking to thousands of veterans at the American Legion National Convention;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-002.wav|Today I want to speak to all Americans about what we can learn from the men and women of our incredible armed forces;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-003.wav|Every person who puts on the uniform makes our nation proud;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-004.wav|They all come from across our land;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-005.wav|They represent every race, ethnicity, and creed, but they all pledge the same oath, fight the same cause, and operate as one team with one shared sense of purpose;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-006.wav|They love their families, they cherish their freedom, they salute our flag, and above all they believe in America;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-007.wav|Now we must draw inspiration from their love and loyalty to one another and to our nation as we seek to heal divisions from within;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-008.wav|We must also remember what our service personnel know better than anyone, that we are one people with one home and one glorious American destiny;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-009.wav|We come from all different walks of life, but we all share the same dream, to live in peace and safety, to work with honor and dignity, and to build a better future for those we love;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-010.wav|Together we can achieve this dream, but we must first remember who we are and the values that bind us together;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-011.wav|We must speak out against the voices that try to sow hatred and division;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-012.wav|We must treat our fellow citizens with love and affection, and we must honor our heroes and prove worthy of the sacrifice they've made for all of us;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-013.wav|I ask every American to make a simple promise to the courageous warriors who fight in our name;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-014.wav|When they come home from battle, they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of loyalty that unite us together as one;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-015.wav|Only when we work together with a shared purpose will we carry on the proud tradition of those who came before us;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-016.wav|Only when we honor our history will we have confidence in our future;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-017.wav|And only when we strive for peace among one another will we remain a force for peace all around the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-018.wav|We can achieve this peace, we can foster this unity, and we can rebuild this loyalty, because together, we are truly one nation under God;
./myfolder/VOICE/24-019.wav|Thank you, God bless you;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-001.wav|My fellow Americans, as we celebrate American Dream Week at the White House, we continue to see incredible results;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-002.wav|This week the Dow Jones Industrial average reached an all-time high;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-003.wav|Never ever has it been so high;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-004.wav|In May the unemployment rate hit a sixteen-year low;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-005.wav|And last quarter real GDP growth increased to two point six percent;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-006.wav|Prosperity is coming back to our shores because we're putting American workers and families first;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-007.wav|The American dream has always been about doing what we love, and doing it for the people we love;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-008.wav|Whether serving in the armed forces, manufacturing goods, or starting a small business, our citizens pursue their aspirations and improve the lives of millions in countless, countless ways;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-009.wav|Yet for too long the dreams of many Americans have been put out of reach, by Washington;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-010.wav|Washington funded one global project after another while allowing other countries to drain our jobs, and drain the wealth of the United States of America;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-011.wav|Then Washington taxed and regulated our own workers and industries, taking away their ability to earn a living;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-012.wav|But those days are over;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-013.wav|My administration is working tirelessly on behalf of the American people;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-014.wav|We have removed regulations and targeted unfair trade practices that are hurting Americans all over the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-015.wav|We're ending the war on coal and unleashing American energy;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-016.wav|We are introducing a tax plan to grow our economy and create more jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-017.wav|Factories and plants are coming back into Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and many other states;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-018.wav|They are coming back instead of leaving like they have been for decades;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-019.wav|And just this week we announced a historic immigration bill, to create a merit-based green card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-020.wav|As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country You can't just come in, like in past weeks, years, and decades you come in, immediately start picking up welfare;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-021.wav|For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-022.wav|As I said in my address to Congress, the time for dreaming big bold and daring things for our country has begun;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-023.wav|When Americans are free to pursue their dreams, there is no limit to what we can achieve;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-024.wav|This is truly an exciting time in our country Every day, we're accomplishing great things for our people;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-025.wav|Thank you, God bless you, God bless the United States;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-026.wav|We're really moving along, we're bringing back our jobs, we're making America great again;
./myfolder/VOICE/25-027.wav|Thank you;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-001.wav|My fellow Americans, On Monday I signed a Presidential Proclamation declaring this to be, Made in America Week;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-002.wav|We believe that our country is stronger safer and more prosperous when we make more of our goods and our products right here in the USA;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-003.wav|When we purchase products Made in America, the wealth, revenue and jobs all stay in our country - to be enjoyed by our people;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-004.wav|Since we first won our Independence our Founders and many of our greatest leaders have promoted that we should afford a special level of protection to the products and goods manufactured within our borders;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-005.wav|They understood that as a nation, we have common bonds with our fellow citizens and common obligations to each other;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-006.wav|Making and buying made in America products brings us closer, and strengthens the ties that link us all together;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-007.wav|For too long our government's policies have punished production in America while rewarding and encouraging the movement of production overseas which is totally ridiculous;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-008.wav|The result has been the loss of numerous industries, the decimation of entire communities and years of sluggish growth and flat wages;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-009.wav|Throughout American history our nation's best leaders have believed in the importance of protecting our domestic industry;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-010.wav|This includes every President on Mount Rushmore;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-011.wav|George Washington encouraged Americans to produce their own goods so that our young nation could become truly independent;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-012.wav|Thomas Jefferson wrote that Americans should choose products made in America whenever possible and by the way I'm asking you to do that;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-013.wav|Abraham Lincoln warned that abandoning the policies that protect American industry would produce want and ruin among our people;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-014.wav|Theodore Roosevelt stated in his First message to Congress that Reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-015.wav|James Monroe called on our nation to cherish and sustain our manufacturers;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-016.wav|James Garfield said of our nation's manufacturers: To them the country owes the splendor of the position it holds before the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-017.wav|William McKinley believed that when America protects our workers and industries, we open up a higher and better destiny for our people;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-018.wav|And Calvin Coolidge stated that protecting American industry enables our people to live according to a better standard and receive a better rate of compensation than any people anytime anywhere on earth, ever enjoyed;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-019.wav|We are now under the Trump Administration reclaiming our heritage as a manufacturing nation;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-020.wav|We are fighting to provide a level playing field for American Workers and Industries;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-021.wav|Other countries will cease taking advantage of us, believe me;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-022.wav|We are going to build works of beauty and wonder - with American hands, American grit, and American iron, aluminum and steel;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-023.wav|No longer will we allow other countries to break the rules, steal our jobs, and drain our wealth;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-024.wav|Instead we will follow two simple but very crucial rules: We will buy American and we will hire American;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-025.wav|Already we have created over a million new jobs this year - and doing even better than anticipated;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-026.wav|We are just getting started - believe me, we are just getting started;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-027.wav|For every job that comes back to this country and every factory that reopens and every town that is revitalized, we aren't just restoring American wealth, we are restoring American pride;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-028.wav|We are restoring America's future - a future where millions will be lifted from welfare to work, where children will grow up in safe and vibrant communities and where our nation will stand stronger than ever before;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-029.wav|And most importantly, it will be a future in which you our citizens always come first;
./myfolder/VOICE/27-030.wav|Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America - we are truly making it great again;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-001.wav|My fellow Americans, next week the Senate is going to vote on legislation to save Americans from the Obamacare disaster;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-002.wav|Obamacare has wreaked havoc on American lives and if we don't replace it, the calamity will only get worse and I mean get worse by a lot;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-003.wav|Here's just one story, representative of so many others;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-004.wav|Carrie Kuhy and her husband are cattle ranchers;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-005.wav|They have six children and the youngest is autistic;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-006.wav|Her family's rates under Obamacare skyrocketed eventually costing the Kuhy's three times more than their previous plan;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-007.wav|They were dropped from health insurance four times under Obamacare;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-008.wav|When I met with Carrie in March, she told us that her family couldn't afford the equipment they needed to do the jobs while paying these crushing insurance premiums;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-009.wav|Americans like Carrie and her family desperately need relief;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-010.wav|from this terrible, terrible law;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-011.wav|The Democratic politicians who passed Obamacare, made many big promises, but they turned out to be lies, absolute total lies;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-012.wav|They promised Obamacare would reduce premiums by two thousand five hundred dollars;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-013.wav|Instead premiums have skyrocketed by numbers that nobody can even believe;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-014.wav|Sometimes, many many thousands of dollars;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-015.wav|They promised that if you liked your plan you could keep your plan;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-016.wav|Instead millions of American families saw their plans canceled;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-017.wav|They promised Obamacare would offer better options for American families but in the past two years, half the insurance companies have pulled out and left the individual market;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-018.wav|And today Americans in one third of all counties have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges and they probably will shortly have no insurers at all;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-019.wav|The Senate healthcare bill stops the Obamacare disaster;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-020.wav|It expands choice and drives down costs;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-021.wav|And I want to tell you the Republican senators are working very hard to get something that's going to be really, really good;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-022.wav|The opposite of the big lie which was Obamacare;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-023.wav|The bill would reduce premiums by thirty percent or more by two thousand twenty;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-024.wav|It allows states freedom to escape even more of Obamacare's rules and create innovative healthcare solutions, for their citizens;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-025.wav|In other words, we'll be taking something away from the federal government and getting it back to the states, who can better provide and who know better what to do;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-026.wav|It provides generous funding for people with expensive health conditions, which will lower premiums in the individual market;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-027.wav|The bill doubles the amount that Americans can contribute to tax-free health savings accounts, and allows you to use those accounts to pay your premiums;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-028.wav|This plan provides states with the much-needed flexibility to better manage their Medicaid programs, it maintains Medicaid coverage for every single elderly American, disabled American and American child, who is currently on the program;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-029.wav|It also expands the opportunity for people on Medicaid to purchase a private plan with federal financial assistance;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-030.wav|And with these much-needed long-term reforms to strengthen the safety net for our neediest citizens, the Obamacare repeal and replace plan would significantly reduce the federal deficit;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-031.wav|So it would be good for the federal government, it'll cost you less money by a lot and it'll be a much better plan;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-032.wav|You can't do better than that;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-033.wav|When I ran for President I made a commitment to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-034.wav|I am pleased to report that we are very very close, to ending this healthcare nightmare;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-035.wav|We are so close;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-036.wav|The legislation working its way through Congress provides the choice and control people want, the affordability they need and the quality they deserve in healthcare;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-037.wav|It's a common-sense approach that restores the sacred doctor patient relationship and you're going to finally have great healthcare at a lower price;
./myfolder/VOICE/28-038.wav|Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-001.wav|My fellow Americans, Here at the White House we are dedicating the month of July to three of our favorite words;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-002.wav|Made in America;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-003.wav|For more than two centuries those three beautiful words have been the world standard for quality, craftsmanship, and excellence, and they still are today;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-004.wav|As President one of my highest priorities is to restore American manufacturing;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-005.wav|For decades American jobs have been ripped out of our communities;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-006.wav|Industries and towns have been stripped bare and the entire communities have been uprooted and left;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-007.wav|Foreign nations got rich at America's expense and many special interests profited from this great global theft of American wealth;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-008.wav|Since taking the oath of office our government has adopted a new philosophy;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-009.wav|America first;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-010.wav|And believe me, it's about time;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-011.wav|The era of economic surrender is over and a new national pride is sweeping across our land;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-012.wav|You see it, I see it, we all see it;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-013.wav|Industry confidence has soared to the highest level ever recorded;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-014.wav|One of my first acts was ordering all federal agencies to enforce two simple rules;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-015.wav|Buy American and hire American;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-016.wav|We want to build with American workers and with American iron, aluminum and steel;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-017.wav|We're also tearing down every possible barrier to domestic energy production to unleash the full power of our economy;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-018.wav|The American people will finally be allowed to tap into the vast energy wealth sitting right beneath our feet, or right below our shores;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-019.wav|We have also sent a clear message to the world that we will not allow other nations to take advantage of us any longer;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-020.wav|That's why I withdrew from the one-sided Paris climate Accord and believe me it was one-sided;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-021.wav|Not a good deal for our country and the job-killing trans pacific partnership;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-022.wav|And that's why we are pursuing a total renegotiation of NAFTA and if we don't get it we will terminate that is end NAFTA forever;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-023.wav|Every other nation on Earth protects its own interests;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-024.wav|America is finally going to do the same and as we continue to fight for American workers in industry, it won't be long before we see the made in America label proudly displayed;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-025.wav|on thousands of new products all across this great land and exported all around the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-026.wav|Thank you, god bless you;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-027.wav|God bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-028.wav|We're all doing a job, we're working very hard, it will be America first, it will be make America great again;
./myfolder/VOICE/29-029.wav|It's happening;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-001.wav|My fellow Americans, This week I was joined at the White House by American families whose loved ones were killed by illegal immigrants;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-002.wav|Many of these illegal immigrants had extensive criminal records and had been repeatedly deported;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-003.wav|Every single one of these deaths was preventable;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-004.wav|These beautiful American lives were stolen because our government refused to do its job;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-005.wav|If the government had simply enforced our immigration laws these Americans would still be alive today;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-006.wav|That's why, since the day I took the oath of office, I have been restoring the enforcement of our immigration laws and the protection and defense of our borders;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-007.wav|These courageous Americans joined me at the White House to call on Congress to pass two bills, that I campaigned on during the election;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-008.wav|If enacted these bills will save countless Americans lives;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-009.wav|The first bill, Kate's Law, is named for Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-010.wav|This law will enhance criminal penalties for those who repeatedly re-enter, our country illegally;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-011.wav|The second bill, the No Sanctuary For Criminals Act, will block federal grants to jurisdictions that shield dangerous criminal aliens from being turned over to federal law enforcement;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-012.wav|On Thursday I am glad to report, these two bills passed the House of Representatives;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-013.wav|This represents a crucial step toward ensuring our public safety and national security;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-014.wav|I want to thank Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte for his dedicated work on these critical bills, as well as other crucial legislation that will soon be considered as well;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-015.wav|I also thank Leadership for advancing these life-saving measures;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-016.wav|I now call on the Senate to take up these bills and send them back to my desk for signature - as soon as possible;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-017.wav|We need security;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-018.wav|We need safety in our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-019.wav|And I call on members of both parties to stand united with victims to stop these terrible and senseless crimes from ever happening in the first place;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-020.wav|This legislation presents a simple choice: either vote to save and protect American lives, or vote to shield and comfort criminal aliens who threaten innocent lives - and they've been shielded too long;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-021.wav|As we head towards the Fourth of July we remember now more than ever to cherish our freedom;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-022.wav|The foundation of freedom is the rule of law;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-023.wav|It forms the bedrock of our Constitution and the cornerstone of our way of life;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-024.wav|So this Independence Day, while we're enjoying treasured time with our friends and loved ones, let us not forget the families who have an empty seat at the table this year;
./myfolder/VOICE/30-025.wav|And let us pledge that from now on, we will protect, defend and save, American lives;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-001.wav|My fellow Americans, Millions of families across our nation are suffering under the disaster known as Obamacare;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-002.wav|Traveling throughout our country over the last two years, I have met so many of these wonderful Americans and I have never forgotten their stories;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-003.wav|In Wisconsin I recently met a proud Veteran and his wife - Michael and Tammy Kushman;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-004.wav|When they were forced onto Obamacare and the exchange in twenty fifteen they thought they would be able to keep their doctor but they couldn't;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-005.wav|They thought they would be able to keep their plan - but they weren't allowed;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-006.wav|They were told their premiums would go down but instead they soared by one hundred and twenty percent upward;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-007.wav|It was one Obamacare lie after another;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-008.wav|Today the Kushmans spend one thousand four hundred dollars a month on health insurance - nearly one-fourth of their entire net monthly income;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-009.wav|On the same visit I met another family Robert and Sarah Stoll;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-010.wav|Robert is a volunteer captain for his local fire department;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-011.wav|After their Obamacare premiums nearly doubled, they needed extra money and Sarah had no choice but to leave retirement to pay their bills;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-012.wav|But this new income meant they were no longer eligible for the tax credit they had once received and the federal government actually forced them to repay thousands and thousands of dollars;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-013.wav|These families and so many others are victims of a catastrophic law that is wreaking havoc on our healthcare system and our families;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-014.wav|Democrats in Congress created this calamity and now, if we don't act, millions more Americans will be hurt by Obamacare's deepening death spiral;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-015.wav|Americans were promised lower premiums, more choices and better access;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-016.wav|Instead premiums have doubled nationwide - and insurers are still fleeing the market that Obamacare has nearly destroyed;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-017.wav|Americans in nearly one-third of all counties have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges - and many markets may soon have no insurers at all;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-018.wav|It really is a disaster;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-019.wav|The American people are calling out for relief, and my administration is determined to provide it - and we are working with Congress to get a bill to my desk so we can rescue Americans from this catastrophe;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-020.wav|As families across the nation continue to suffer under this law, I only hope that Democrats in Congress will have the political courage;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-021.wav|to help fix what we know to be a catastrophic situation - a total disaster - that they have created;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-022.wav|To be part of the solution, instead of obstructing - always obstructing - change, blocking reform, and doubling-down on Obamacare's failure;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-023.wav|But no matter what, my Administration will never stop fighting for you - and for the healthcare system that you deserve;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-024.wav|We'll get it done;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-025.wav|Even if we don't have any help from the Democrats, we'll get it done;
./myfolder/VOICE/31-026.wav|Thank you, God bless you and God bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-001.wav|My fellow Americans, This week our nation was shocked and horrified when a gunman opened fire on a Member of Congress;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-002.wav|Five people were wounded in the assault, including a member of House Leadership - my good friend, Steve Scalise;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-003.wav|Steve is beloved across Washington, he embodies everything public service is about - he's dedicated to his constituents, devoted to his values and deeply committed to his country;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-004.wav|I visited Steve, his wife and his family in the hospital, as he continues to fight, for his recovery;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-005.wav|Four hundred thirty five Members of Congress, and three hundred million Americans are pulling for him, praying for him, and pledging to him our full and total support;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-006.wav|We continue to hold all of those wounded and fighting for recovery in our hearts, and prayers, including Matt Mika, who was also badly wounded;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-007.wav|In that terrible crime, we also witnessed the incredible heroism of Capitol Police;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-008.wav|Special Agent Crystal Griner - who I also had the honor of meeting during my visit to the Hospital - raced into gunfire, along with Special Agent David Bailey;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-009.wav|They saved the lives of our Members of Congress and prevented that dark day from becoming a tragedy beyond imagination;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-010.wav|They like so many other courageous police office, represent the very best of us;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-011.wav|We salute them and we also salute members of Alexandria Police Fire and Rescue;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-012.wav|Though we have our differences, what unites us is so much stronger: our love of country, our devotion to its people;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-013.wav|Now more than ever these values must guide us - and bring us closer together;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-014.wav|Let us always remember that our job is to serve and represent the whole American People - and that we are all children of the same God;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-015.wav|This week my Administration continues our focus on providing economic opportunity for all;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-016.wav|On Thursday I signed an Executive Order to launch a groundbreaking new Apprenticeship Initiative that will help young Americans learn the skills they need to find a rewarding career, earn a great living and support themselves and their families;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-017.wav|We are celebrating the dignity of work and the greatness of the American Worker;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-018.wav|American citizens have worked every job, every occupation, no matter what it might be - no matter how grueling, how challenging, or even how dangerous;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-019.wav|They wash the windows on our tallest skyscrapers, they create works of art from burning fire and molten steel, they mine the earth and dive the ocean depths to bring energy into our cities and towns;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-020.wav|they care for the sick, the elderly and the wounded, and they lay the bricks mortar rebar and concrete that give us places to live, to work and to thrive;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-021.wav|Today, this is the message I want every young American to hear: there is dignity in every honest job, and there is nobility in every honest worker;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-022.wav|Our Apprenticeship Initiative will make it dramatically easier for employers, industry groups and unions to create exciting new apprenticeship programs that place students into high-paying careers;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-023.wav|Instead of being racked with crushing student debt, those who participate will earn while they learn - think of that: earn while they learn;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-024.wav|Under our plan young Americans will have a pathway to exciting and fulfilling careers;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-025.wav|They will become brilliant technicians who revitalize American manufacturing;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-026.wav|They will become welders who forge from fire amazing works of iron and steel and art;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-027.wav|And they will become entrepreneurs who revolutionize entire industries;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-028.wav|And these striving American citizens including millions of talented young American women with tremendous potential, will become the programmers who change the world with the next great technological advance;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-029.wav|Every American deserves a path to a great job that they truly love;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-030.wav|That begins with the right education - one that gives students the foundation for a lifetime of success;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-031.wav|Every day, as your President, I will be committed to this goal;
./myfolder/VOICE/32-032.wav|Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-001.wav|My fellow Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-002.wav|we are the nation that built the Golden Gate bridge in four years and the Hoover dam in five;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-003.wav|Now it takes us much as a decade just to plan a major permit or a major infrastructure or anything even remotely major in our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-004.wav|And that's ridiculous;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-005.wav|And it's going to change;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-006.wav|This week I laid out a bold and exciting new vision for the infrastructure in America that will make our country faster, safer and wealthier;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-007.wav|Frankly it will make our country greater;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-008.wav|For too long America has spent trillions and trillions of dollars building up other countries while our own country decade, and our own people suffered;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-009.wav|Our highways and railways and airports and seaports have all been neglected and its holding our economy back but now our economy is starting to roar;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-010.wav|And it's time to rebuild our great nation;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-011.wav|And we have to think big and think big again;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-012.wav|My new vision for American infrastructure will generate one trillion dollars in infrastructure investment were going to give states and localities more power to decide what projects get built and how they're funded;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-013.wav|And were going to get government out of the way by massively cutting the federal approval time for infrastructure projects of major nature so that America can build again;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-014.wav|We will also revolutionize air travel in America at a time when every passenger has GPS technology in their pockets, our air traffic controllers rely on technology so outdated it's no longer manufactured;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-015.wav|Our controllers do a great job with the technology they have but all the flight delays and inefficiencies still cost our economy twenty-five billion dollars every single year;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-016.wav|were proposing to move our air traffic control system to a new self-finance nonprofit organization;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-017.wav|It won't need any tax payer money and the FAA will still be in charge of safety many other countries have done this and the results have been absolutely incredible;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-018.wav|Next were going to revitalize the twelve thousand miles of inland waterways, the life blood of the American heartland;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-019.wav|our agriculture steel and energy produces all depend on these critical charters and a single tow boat can haul the same load as one thousand eighteen-wheelers;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-020.wav|were going to fix our fifty year old system of locks and dams so American producers can get their products to market quickly, reliably and efficiently;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-021.wav|in the Coming weeks and months I will outline additional projects to rebuilt American infrastructure;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-022.wav|all of which can be achieved through my vision for a new partnership between Washington, states, and the private sector;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-023.wav|With the talent skill and drive of the American people there is no doubt to the beautiful future we can create together;
./myfolder/VOICE/33-024.wav|All it takes is a bold and daring vision and the will to make it real, America is going to build again under budget and ahead of schedule thank you, god bless you, and god bless of America;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-001.wav|My fellow Americans, I am thrilled to be back in the United States after our first historic foreign trip;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-002.wav|Over the course of nine days Melania and I traveled to some of the holiest sites in the three Abrahamic religions and met with nearly one hundred foreign leaders;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-003.wav|Everywhere we went my goal was to advance American interests, to build a coalition of nations to drive out the terrorists, and to unlock a future of peace, prosperity and hope for all Americans - and people around the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-004.wav|In Saudi Arabia I was honored to participate in a historic summit;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-005.wav|with the leaders of more than fifty Muslim and Arab nations, where King Salman and many other leaders expressed their desire to take on a greater role in defeating terrorists who murder innocents of all faiths;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-007.wav|I also discussed the importance of the nations of the region taking more responsibility on migration - so that more young people are part of creating a better future in their home societies;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-008.wav|From Saudi Arabia I traveled to Jerusalem, where I reaffirmed the unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-009.wav|There I prayed at the Western Wall, visited the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, and was awed by the majesty of that sacred land and the perseverance of the Jewish people;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-010.wav|I also traveled to Bethlehem another ancient city of wonder, where I met with Palestinian leader, President Abbas;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-011.wav|Both President Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu assured me they are ready to reach for peace;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-012.wav|From Israel I traveled to Italy where Melania and I were greatly honored to visit the Vatican and meet Pope Francis;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-013.wav|He was really wonderful - a great guy;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-014.wav|Then I traveled to two summits;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-015.wav|with our key allies first, the NATO Summit in Brussels, where nations agreed they must do more to meet their financial obligations and pay their fair share - because right now, it is not fair to the United States;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-016.wav|But it soon will be;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-017.wav|Next I attended the G-seven Summit in Italy, where we worked to improve coordination on shared security threats, achieve more fair trade that gives workers a level playing field;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-018.wav|and agreed on the goal that refugees should be resettled as close to their home countries as possible so they can be part of the future rebuilding;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-019.wav|Before we returned home, I was delighted to conclude my trip by visiting American military families - unbelievable people, the true source of our strength;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-020.wav|We will always protect those who protect us;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-021.wav|Our first foreign trip was full of historic and unprecedented achievements;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-022.wav|Joined by many old and new friends, we have paved the way for the new era of cooperation - one that calls upon each nation to take more responsibility to bring peace to their people;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-023.wav|One that works together to defeat the scourge of terrorism and deliver hope to all of God's children;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-024.wav|And one that protects American interests so we remain a strong and prosperous nation - strong and prosperous, like never before - and a beacon of freedom and opportunity for many years to come;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-025.wav|Thank you. God bless you;
./myfolder/VOICE/34-026.wav|And God bless the United States of America;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-001.wav|My fellow Americans, Each month families across the country work very very hard to balance their budgets and to make the tough choices necessary to take care of their loved ones and to give their children opportunities they never had before;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-002.wav|This is who we are as Americans we take pride in leaving each new generation a better country than the one we inherited;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-003.wav|Yet for decades Washington has refused to make the tough choices;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-004.wav|As a result the American Dream has slipped from the grasp of more and more of our people;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-005.wav|This has to change;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-006.wav|We need a government that spends on the right things - the safety, security and well-being of our people - and stops the waste and abuse of taxpayer funds, whether in America or in global projects overseas - of which perhaps, there are too many;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-007.wav|My administration is laying a new foundation to build a future of economic prosperity and achieve American Greatness;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-008.wav|The budget we are proposing will reverse economic stagnation and open the path to millions of new jobs for American workers;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-009.wav|We will balance the budget without making cuts in Social Security and Medicare;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-010.wav|We will achieve our goals by doing exactly what you do in your home: setting priorities, cutting the fat, and growing new opportunities;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-011.wav|And the big thing for me is economic growth, which is not possible without safety and security;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-012.wav|We will grow our economy it is growing already;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-013.wav|It will grow faster than you've seen it in decades;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-014.wav|That is why our budget reverses years of cuts to our military that have made us less safe in a more dangerous world;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-015.wav|We are going to make sure the men and women on the front lines of freedom, have the tools they need to keep us safe and totally secure;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-016.wav|At home we are going to give our ICE officers who have done an incredible job - and our Border Patrol agents who are amazing people - everything they need to end the lawlessness once and for all;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-017.wav|It is our moral duty to keep our citizens safe and free, and to protect the right of every American to pursue their dreams;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-018.wav|We don't want MS thirteen roving our streets, we're getting rid of them by the thousands, they're going to be out of here;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-019.wav|But I'm proud to tell you that the first budget we are releasing provides a firm new foundation for the safety and also for jobs and prosperity for all Americans in the years to come;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-020.wav|Thank you very much;
./myfolder/VOICE/35-021.wav|You're going to love the end result;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-001.wav|My fellow Americans, Confidence in the American economy has reached levels not seen in many many years;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-002.wav|Unemployment fell to its lowest level in nearly ten years last month and we created two hundred eleven thousand new jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-003.wav|Our economic progress is especially good news for the millions of young Americans who, at this time of the year, are putting on a cap and gown and receiving a diploma, certificate, or commission;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-004.wav|So important, and we are so proud of them;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-005.wav|This weekend, I am delighted to be participating first hand in the excitement by joining the students and faculty at Liberty University to celebrate the success of their graduates;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-006.wav|I was invited to make the commencement address at West Point, but I will be away at the G seven - and I look forward to that and will be at West Point, Annapolis the Air Force Academy;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-007.wav|Come to think about it, a few days later, I will actually travel to New London Connecticut to speak, to the graduating cadets of the United States Coast Guard Academy about their new roles serving our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-008.wav|So we'll be with them very shortly;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-009.wav|To young Americans at both schools I will be bringing a message of hope and optimism about our nation's bright future;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-010.wav|That is a message that I want to extend to all young Americans today, especially those who are graduating this year and entering the labor force;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-011.wav|We are also celebrating all of the Americans who learn the skills and trades that generations of workers have used to build shape and supply this nation;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-012.wav|The people who construct, repair and create with their own two hands are the people who make this nation run;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-013.wav|And lots of those people voted for me;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-014.wav|That's also why, in my Administration, I am so deeply committed to technical and vocational education;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-015.wav|I want you to know that my administration is working every single day to create new opportunities and to reverse years of stagnant growth, falling wages, and disappearing jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-016.wav|We are ending the sellout of American workers and lifting the burdens on American industry manufacturing and businesses;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-017.wav|We also rolling back job killing regulations that make it harder for companies to grow and hire in America;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-018.wav|At the same time, we are unleashing American energy development to create thousands of new jobs on our soil and just off our shores;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-019.wav|On trade we have also taken historic action, to protect American industry and bring back the kinds of high-paying jobs that can support a middle class family - and in fact, most families;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-020.wav|As a vote of confidence in these policies, business optimism is soaring and employment is rising;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-021.wav|These are great signs for America's future - the future that our new graduates will play with such a critical role in shaping our world and our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-022.wav|I want every young citizen - regardless of education or geography - to be able to live out their American Dreams;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-023.wav|So to all of America's graduates, congratulations;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-024.wav|And to all of America's youth: we are here to help;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-025.wav|The brightest days are ahead of you;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-026.wav|And I just look forward to seeing you at the Coast Guard Academy, and at Liberty University;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-027.wav|Thank you God Bless You;
./myfolder/VOICE/37-028.wav|And God Bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-001.wav|My fellow Americans, I truly believe that the first one hundred days of my Administration has been just about the most successful in our country's history;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-002.wav|Most importantly, were bringing back jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-004.wav|See the car companies come roaring back in;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-005.wav|They don't want to leave;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-006.wav|They want to stay here;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-007.wav|They want a piece of the action;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-008.wav|Our country is going up and it's going up fast;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-009.wav|Our companies are doing better they just announced fantastic profits all because of what's happened in this rather short period of time;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-010.wav|And that's just the beginning;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-011.wav|We're putting in a massive tax cut for the middle class and for business;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-012.wav|It's goinna have an enormous effect;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-013.wav|The massive Keystone Pipeline the Dakota Pipeline tens of thousands of jobs right there;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-014.wav|And so many other businesses;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-015.wav|We're really proud of what we're doing;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-016.wav|The F thirty five fighter jet program it was way over budget;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-017.wav|I've saved seven hundred and twenty five million dollars plus, just by getting involved in the negotiation;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-018.wav|We're cutting costs and we're going to have a truly competitive and great country again;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-019.wav|In just fourteen weeks my administration has brought profound change to Washington;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-020.wav|The most fundamental change can be found in the relationship between the people and their government;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-021.wav|For too long politicians cared more about special interests than they did about a very successful future for all Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-022.wav|They took our taxpayers money, and sent their jobs and wealth to other countries;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-023.wav|Not anymore;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-024.wav|From the first day of my administration I have governed by a simple idea: My only allegiance is to you, our wonderful citizens;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-025.wav|Together we are seeing that great achievements are possible when we put American People first;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-026.wav|That is why I withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-027.wav|That day was a turning point for our nation;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-028.wav|It put the countries of this world on notice that the sellout of the American worker was over;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-029.wav|In the following weeks I took unprecedented actions to reverse Federal overreach and unleash job creation;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-030.wav|We have slashed burdensome regulations, and imposed a policy that for each new regulation, two regulations must be erased from the books;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-031.wav|We've done it all while moving quickly to restore the most basic protection for all citizens, the rule of law;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-032.wav|A truly great judge, Neil Gorsuch, now sits on the United States Supreme Court;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-033.wav|Justice Gorsuch is deeply devoted to our Constitution;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-034.wav|My Administration is the first in the modern political era to confirm a new Supreme Court Justice in the first one hundred days the last time it happened was one hundred and thirty-six years ago in eighteen eighty-one;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-035.wav|Defending the rule of law is a priority not just in the courts but also on the streets and on the border;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-036.wav|We've told the incredible police of our nation that they have our full support as they work to bring down violent crime rates;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-037.wav|We've taken bold action to go after criminal cartels and made it a top priority to prosecute anyone who targets law enforcement;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-038.wav|This has been the work of my administration fighting for the American worker, defending the rule of law and returning the power to the American people;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-039.wav|Since my inauguration economic confidence has soared, reaching higher than any time in nine years;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-040.wav|Optimism among manufacturers is at a record high;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-041.wav|And small business confidence has seen its largest increase in nearly four decades;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-042.wav|Perhaps the greatest change of all is the renewal of the American Spirit;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-043.wav|As long as we have faith in each other and trust in God, then the sun will always shine on our very glorious republic;
./myfolder/VOICE/39-044.wav|Thank you, God Bless You and God Bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-001.wav|My fellow Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-002.wav|A new optimism is sweeping our country as we return power from Washington and give it back to the American People where it belongs;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-003.wav|For too long, American workers were forgotten by their government and I mean totally forgotten;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-004.wav|Their interests were pushed aside for global projects and their wealth was taken from their communities and shipped across the world, all across the seas;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-005.wav|My Administration has offered a new vision;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-006.wav|The well-being of the American citizen and worker will be placed second to none - and boy do I mean second to none;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-007.wav|Since Day One I have been fighting for the hardworking people of this country - and this week we took historic action to continue delivering on that promise;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-008.wav|We did so in one of the many proud industrial towns of our nation - Kenosha, Wisconsin - with the men and women of Snap-On, who make American tools for workers around the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-009.wav|They were there and they loved what they heard and they loved what they saw;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-010.wav|In Wisconsin, I signed an Executive Order to Buy American and Hire American;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-011.wav|I took historic action to ensure that Federal Projects are made with American Goods - and to keep American workers and companies from being cheated out of contracts;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-012.wav|by countries that break the rules and break every regulation in the book to take advantage of the United States;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-013.wav|That's not gonna happen anymore;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-014.wav|I also took action to reform our immigration system so that it puts the needs of American workers first - the duty of government is to represent the citizens of the United States and that is what we will do;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-015.wav|Whether it's removing job-killing regulations, protecting our borders or unleashing American energy, we are keeping our promises and delivering for the American Worker;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-016.wav|During my visit I talked about how America is a nation that honors work;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-017.wav|We honor grit;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-018.wav|We honor craftsmanship;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-019.wav|We honor the skilled tradespeople who turn rock and steel and iron and cement into works of art and grace and beauty;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-020.wav|There's tremendous talent there believe me;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-021.wav|The wrench and ratchet are not only tools but instruments that help build cities out of deserts and send ships across the ocean;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-022.wav|And the tools of craftsmen and the masons are just as important;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-023.wav|as the tools of the doctor and the dentist or the CEO or even the tools of politicians believe it or not - and their work is every bit as noble;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-024.wav|They take pride in their jobs and we take pride in them;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-025.wav|No longer will the concerns of these hardworking Americans go unanswered;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-026.wav|By making government answer to our citizens we are removing the limits on our future and setting free the dreams of our people;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-027.wav|As long as we do this, optimism will continue to soar;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-028.wav|Hope will continue to spring;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-029.wav|And this country we love will grow stronger and stronger day by day;
./myfolder/VOICE/40-030.wav|Thank you, God Bless you, and God Bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-001.wav|My fellow Americans, This is a season of great hope;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-002.wav|This week Jewish families across our country, and around the world, celebrate Passover and retell the story of God's deliverance of the Jewish people;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-003.wav|The story of the Exodus is a story of freedom;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-004.wav|It is the story of an incredible people who were liberated from oppression and raised up the face of humankind;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-005.wav|Down through the centuries, the Jewish People have lived through one persecution after another and yet they persevered and thrived and uplifted the world beyond measure;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-006.wav|And now the State of Israel stands as a monument to their faith and endurance;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-007.wav|Another day of faith and celebration is also upon us;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-008.wav|This Easter Sunday, Christians celebrate the resurrection of Christ and the promise of eternal salvation;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-009.wav|It is a holy day of reverence and worship, it is a sacred time that fills the spirit of our Nation with the faith of our people;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-010.wav|America is a Nation of believers;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-011.wav|As families gather in houses of worship across the Nation, we are grateful for the tremendous blessings of this land, our home;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-012.wav|We have a beautiful country, an abundant countryside, and an amazing people with a truly bright and wonderful future;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-013.wav|From the beginning America has been a place that has cherished the freedom of worship;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-014.wav|That is the promise the first settlers saw in our vast continent - and it is the promise that our bravest warriors have protected for all of our citizens in centuries since, a long time ago;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-015.wav|Sadly many around the globe do not enjoy this freedom - and one of the gravest threats to religious freedom remains the threat of terror;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-016.wav|On Palm Sunday as Christians around the world celebrate the beginning of Holy Week, ISIS murdered at least forty-five people and injured over one hundred others at two Christian churches in Egypt;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-017.wav|We condemn this barbaric attack;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-018.wav|We mourn for those who lost loved ones;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-019.wav|And we pray for the strength and wisdom to achieve a better tomorrow - one where good people of all faiths, Christians and Muslims and Jewish and Hindu, can follow their hearts and worship according to their conscience;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-020.wav|With God's grace life always triumphs over death, freedom overcomes oppression and faith extinguishes fear;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-021.wav|This is the source of our hope and our confidence in the future;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-022.wav|I also want to give a special message to those struggling Americans who have felt for too long the bitter taste of hardship;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-023.wav|I want you to know: this White House is fighting for you;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-024.wav|We are fighting for every American who has been left behind;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-025.wav|We are fighting for the right of all citizens to enjoy safety and peace - and to work and live with the dignity that all Children of God are entitled to know;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-026.wav|As long as we have faith in each other, and trust in God, we will succeed;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-027.wav|Thank you;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-028.wav|Have a Happy Easter, a Happy Passover;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-029.wav|God bless you;
./myfolder/VOICE/41-030.wav|And God bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-001.wav|My Fellow Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-002.wav|We're only eleven weeks in but already my administration has achieved historic progress for the American people - in fact ninety-three percent of our domestic manufacturers have expressed optimism in the future, a record;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-003.wav|The confidence we are seeing in our Nation is about jobs and opportunity - but it's also about safety and security;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-004.wav|Security begins at the border - as a candidate I pledged to take swift and decisive action to secure the border and that is exactly what I have done;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-005.wav|We inherited a full-fledged border crisis it was a disaster;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-006.wav|Yet with quick and bold steps, we have so far exceeded even the most bullish predictions for the progress we could make in so short a period of time;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-007.wav|Last month we saw a sixty four percent reduction in illegal immigration on our southern border;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-008.wav|At the same time, we are conducting enforcement actions across the country to remove dangerous criminal aliens from our society - and they'll be gone;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-009.wav|In just the last few days our Nation's ICE officers have arrested one hundred and fifty three criminal aliens in south Texas, eighty four criminal aliens in the Pacific Northwest and thirty one criminal aliens in Long Island New York;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-010.wav|these arrests include, aliens convicted of robbery, burglary, aggravated assault, sexual assault against a child, smuggling, drug dealing, and many more;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-011.wav|Much work needs to be done to reverse decades of harm caused by open border policies from Washington - but with time, dedication and effort, we will get the job done and save countless lives in the process;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-012.wav|Providing security for the American People also means restoring America's standing in the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-013.wav|From the very start of my Presidency I have worked to strengthen our alliances and improve our relationships all around the globe;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-014.wav|This week I was honored to welcome the President of Egypt and the King of Jordan to the White House;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-015.wav|Now I am hosting a summit with President Xi of China at the Southern White House to address the many critical issues affecting our two peoples;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-016.wav|In our dealings with other nations our conversations have been candid, open and grounded in mutual respect;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-017.wav|I have been clear about advocating for the national interests of the United States, something so important to me, and so important to our people - one of the reasons, certainly, that I got elected;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-018.wav|I want to ensure that the decisions we make truly serve the safety and security of our citizens;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-019.wav|In matters both economic and military, we understand that a strong America is in the best interests of the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-020.wav|that is why it is so important that as we strengthen international partnerships, we ensure these partnerships deliver real results for Americans and the American people;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-021.wav|Our decisions will be guided by our values and our goals - and we will reject the path of inflexible ideology that too often leads to unintended consequences;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-022.wav|A future of peace, safety and prosperity - that is our guiding light, and always will be;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-023.wav|Together we will bring about this future for the land we love and for the people who call it home;
./myfolder/VOICE/42-024.wav|We love our country and we love the American people Thank you;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-001.wav|My fellow Americans, this week I traveled to Nashville Tennessee, to lay a wreath at the grave of Andrew Jackson on the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of his birth;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-002.wav|Jackson was an American hero first as a brilliant general whose crushing defeat of the British at New Orleans saved our independence in the War of eighteen twelve;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-003.wav|and later as the seventh President of the United States when he fought to defend the forgotten men and women from the arrogant elite of his day;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-004.wav|Does it sound familiar;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-005.wav|The memory of his leadership lives on in our people, and his spirit points us to a better future;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-006.wav|This week I also traveled to the Willow Run Plant in Michigan;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-007.wav|At that facility during the second World War, the Ford Motor Company built not cars, but entire airplanes;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-008.wav|At one point workers there produced complete B twenty four Liberator every single hour;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-009.wav|Hard to believe;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-010.wav|Today on that site is a new facility where the cutting edge cars of the future will be tested, and this week, the old plant was filled once again with thousands of workers and engineers;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-011.wav|I was there to share the good news for the American auto industry;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-012.wav|We announced will be reversing an eleventh hour executive action from the previous administration that was threatening thousands of auto jobs in Michigan and across America, and I mean threatening;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-013.wav|It was very very sad to see;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-014.wav|In fact, we are setting up a task force in every federal agency to identify any unnecessary regulation that is hurting American businesses and American jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-015.wav|The first two job reports of my administration show that we've already added nearly half a million new jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-016.wav|The days of economic surrender for the United States are over;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-017.wav|For too long, special interests have made money shipping jobs over seas;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-018.wav|We need a new economic model;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-019.wav|Let's call it the American Model;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-020.wav|Under this model, we will lower the burden on American business but in exchange, they must hire and grow America and American jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-021.wav|This will be a win-win for our companies and for our workers;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-022.wav|Let's buy American and hire American;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-023.wav|Let's create jobs in America;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-024.wav|Let's imagine new industries, and let's build a beautiful future together;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-025.wav|Among the workers building B twenty four Bombers at the Willow Run Plant during World War Two was one tough lady;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-026.wav|You've might've heard her;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-027.wav|They called her Rosie the Riveter, and when Rosie's country called her, she answered the call;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-028.wav|Rosie was famous for her toughness and her strength, and for the words that were emblazoned above her famous image;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-029.wav|It said very simply, we can do it;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-030.wav|If Americans unite and find again within our nation the soul of Rosie and the spirit of Jackson, I have no doubt that we can do it and do it like never before;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-031.wav|Thank you;
./myfolder/VOICE/45-032.wav|Enjoy your week;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-001.wav|My fellow Americans, in March we celebrate Women's History Month;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-002.wav|Honoring the countless contributions that women leaders, scientists, and entrepreneurs have made throughout American history;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-003.wav|We are a greater stronger and more just nation today because of women like Clara Barton, Susan B Anthony, Harriet Tubman, and so many others;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-004.wav|We honor them and we recommit ourselves to a better future for every woman in America today;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-005.wav|On my fiftieth day in office, I want to talk about an issue of paramount importance to families across our nation, healthcare;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-006.wav|Seven years ago this month, Obamacare was signed into law over the profound objections of American people;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-007.wav|Our citizens were told they'd have to pass Obamacare to find out what it was and how bad it was;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-008.wav|Now we know, that the hundreds of pages were full of broken promises;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-009.wav|Americans were promised that Obamacare would bring premiums down, two thousand five hundred dollars for a typical family;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-010.wav|Instead they've gone up by more than four thousand dollars;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-011.wav|Americans were promised that Obamacare would increase competition and provide them with more choices;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-012.wav|Instead the number of plans to choose from has plummeted, and I mean plummeted;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-013.wav|This year, Americans in nearly one third of all counties have only one insurer to choose from on the exchanges;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-014.wav|Or in effect, no real choice at all;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-015.wav|Americans were promised that if they liked their health insurers and their doctors, they could keep them;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-016.wav|Instead, millions of Americans lost the insurance, and lost the doctor that they liked;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-017.wav|And were thrust into a cold new reality of higher costs and less coverage;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-018.wav|Through seven long years of botched rollouts, soaring costs, canceled plans, and bureaucratic mandates, Americans have called out for relief;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-019.wav|And relief is what we are determined to give them;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-020.wav|I want every American to know that action on Obamacare is an urgent necessity;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-021.wav|The law is collapsing around us, and if we do not act to save Americans from this wreckage, it will take our healthcare system all the way down with it;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-022.wav|If we do nothing millions more innocent Americans will be hurt and badly hurt;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-023.wav|That's why we must repeal and replace Obamacare;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-024.wav|House Republicans have put forward a plan that gets rid of this terrible law and replaces it with reforms that empower states and consumers;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-025.wav|You will have the choice and the freedom to make the decisions that are right for your family;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-026.wav|The House plan follows the guidelines I laid out, in my recent address to Congress;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-027.wav|Expanding choice, lowering costs, and providing healthcare access for all;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-028.wav|This plan is part of a three-pronged reform process, in concert with the plan in front of Congress;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-029.wav|I have directed Dr. Tom Price, our Secretary of Health and Human Services, to use his authority to reduce regulations that are driving up costs of care;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-030.wav|We're also working on reforms that lower the costs of care, like allowing Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines You've heard me say that many many times during the debates;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-031.wav|I encourage Democrats to work with us to improve the healthcare system, for the American people;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-032.wav|Also, we will be driving down the costs;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-033.wav|We will deliver relief to American workers, families and small businesses who right now are being crushed by Obamacare by increasing freedom, choice and opportunity for the American people;
./myfolder/VOICE/46-034.wav|Thank you very much;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-001.wav|My fellow Americans, as Black History Month twenty seventeen comes to a close;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-002.wav|I am very grateful for the many wonderful opportunities to honor African American heroes, faith leaders, entrepreneurs and the many others who changed the course of our nation;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-003.wav|We are blessed by the lives and examples of those who have made this nation of beacon of freedom, talent, and unbreakable American spirit;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-005.wav|It's a new beautiful Smithsonian Museum that serves as a shining example of African Americans incredible contributions to our culture, our Society, and our history;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-006.wav|It also tells of the great struggle for freedom and equality that prevailed against the sins of slavery and the injustice of discrimination;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-007.wav|The work and love of the people who help create such a masterpiece is a testament to the legacy of so many leaders, it honors;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-008.wav|I left that museum confident that together America can overcome any challenge;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-009.wav|there's a great quote by Mohamad Ali in the museum, I shook up the world He said;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-010.wav|And that is what he did;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-011.wav|So did leaders like Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglas, Booker T Washington, Martin Luther King and so many others;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-012.wav|They shook up the world for the better, because they inspired our nation to march toward justice and freedom for all;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-013.wav|Today and everyday I pledge to continue that march so that every American no matter his background, no matter her background has the chance to climb that great ladder of success;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-014.wav|It was very special to accompany Dr. Ben Carson and his family for the first time seeing the Carson exhibit;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-015.wav|I am proud that soon he will serve in my cabinet as the secretary of housing and urban development;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-016.wav|HUD has a very very powerful meaning, far beyond housing;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-017.wav|Its about transforming our communities about bringing back hope and Ben will do a fantastic job;

./myfolder/VOICE/48-019.wav|I want every disadvantaged child in America to have a choice about where they go to school So Important;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-020.wav|I also want to honor and promote the achievements of historically black colleges and universities throughout our nation;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-021.wav|They do a fantastic job;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-022.wav|They're not given the credit that they deserve;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-023.wav|And they're gonna start getting that credit;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-024.wav|In order to help African Americans thrive were working very to make that every child can grow up in a safe community and have access to high paying jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-025.wav|We've lost a lot of our best jobs to other countries and this has hurt the African American community very badly;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-026.wav|This week I met with manufacturing CEOs were going to be working to bring back those jobs and I mean really good paying jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-027.wav|I'll be talking more about these issues in my joint session address to congress and to all Americans next Tuesday evening;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-028.wav|I hope you will be watching;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-029.wav|Thank you, God bless you;
./myfolder/VOICE/48-030.wav|And God Bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-001.wav|My fellow Americans, we have taken major steps during the first few weeks of my administration to remove wasteful regulations and get our people back to work;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-002.wav|I've been saying I was going to do that for a long time;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-003.wav|This week I signed two pieces of legislation to remove burdens on our economy, continue to keep my promises to the American people, and so much more;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-004.wav|I signed House joint resolution thirty eight, which eliminates an anti-coal regulation put forward by unelected bureaucrats;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-005.wav|Our coal miners have been treated horribly, and we are going to turn that around and we're going to turn it around quickly;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-006.wav|We are going to fight for lower energy prices for all Americans as part of the deal;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-007.wav|That's why I also signed a resolution to eliminate a costly regulation Dodd Frank imposed on American energy companies;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-008.wav|By stopping this regulation, we're able to save American companies and workers millions and millions of dollars in job killing compliance costs;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-009.wav|But to truly succeed as a country, we must realize the full potential of women in our economy;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-010.wav|That is why I was thrilled to host the White House's Women's Business Leaders Roundtable;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-011.wav|Very exciting, great women;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-012.wav|As President I am committed to ensuring that women entrepreneurs have equal access to the capital, markets and networks of support that they need - and I mean really need;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-013.wav|And it's going to happen;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-014.wav|This is a priority for my administration;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-015.wav|I campaigned on helping women in the workforce and we are going to deliver on that promise believe me;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-016.wav|In fact, as part of my first official meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, this week, we announced the creation of the joint United States Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-017.wav|Actually, very exciting;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-018.wav|The United States also reaffirmed our unbreakable bond this week, with our cherished ally Israel;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-019.wav|It was an honor to welcome my friend Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to the White House;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-020.wav|I affirmed to the Prime Minister, America's commitment to working with Israel and our allies and partners toward greater security and stability;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-021.wav|The threat of terrorism - and believe me it is a threat, must be confronted and defeated;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-022.wav|And we will defeat it;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-023.wav|We share with Israel a deep conviction that we must protect all innocent human life;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-024.wav|So as you head into President's Day weekend the American people should know that we are working tirelessly on your behalf;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-025.wav|We are not here for the benefit of bureaucrats consultants or pundits;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-026.wav|We are here to work for you, and only for you, the American people;
./myfolder/VOICE/49-027.wav|Thank you, God bless you and God bless America;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-001.wav|My fellow Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-002.wav|this week our hearts are with the people of Louisiana and Mississippi;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-003.wav|Families have lost their homes businesses and livelihoods after devastating tornadoes swept through many many communities;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-004.wav|My administration will make sure they have the support that they need and really desperately want, were going to take care of them;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-005.wav|It's remarkable to see Americans across the country come together to help families rebuild their lives, that is the beauty of the American spirit, there's nothing like it;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-006.wav|There is a great spirit all over the country And that spirit is what we we need to rebuild America, to as ive said so often make America great again;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-007.wav|On Tuesday I was pleased to host at the White House the CEO of Intel who announced Intel will invest seven billion dollars in a new manufacturing facility in Arizona, creating thousands of new American jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-008.wav|That's what we want, new American jobs and good jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-009.wav|Intel decided to move forward with this project because they know we are totally committed to lifting the regulatory and tax burdens that are hurting American innovation and companies;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-010.wav|In fact were in the process right now of working on a major tax reform that will massively reduce taxes on our workers and business;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-011.wav|we want to make it much easier to do business in America and that's what were going to do;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-012.wav|Were going to make also much harder for companies to leave, they're not just going to say bye bye and fire everybody, there will be consequences;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-013.wav|I want America to be the great jobs magnet of the world but we cant do that if don't stop the wasteful rules and excessive taxes that make it impossible for companies to compete;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-014.wav|Every hour of every day my administration is focused on creating jobs for our people and I mean good jobs, more jobs, better jobs, higher paying jobs that's our mission;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-016.wav|I pledged to them that we would stand with the incredible men and women of law enforcement;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-017.wav|and so to will our great new attorney general, Jeff Sessions;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-018.wav|My administration is committed to your security which is why we will continue to fight take all necessary and legal action to keep terrorist, radical and dangerous extremist from ever entering our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-019.wav|We will not allow our generous system of immigration to be turned against us as a tool for terrorism and truly bad people;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-020.wav|We must take firm steps today to ensure that we are safe tomorrow, we will defend our country, protect or constitution and deliver real prosperity for our people;
./myfolder/VOICE/50-021.wav|God Bless you, God bless America, have a great week;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-001.wav|Want welcome everyone to the White House We are very excited to be hosting our third annual Made in America Showcase;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-002.wav|I just went around saw these incredible companies that make everything from the THAAD missiles to beautiful boats;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-003.wav|And I said How would that boat do against the THAAD missile? And it wasn't a good answer;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-004.wav|The boat is going to have a little problem but that's okay;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-005.wav|But I just want to say the engineering inside as you know we have incredible things I'm going in right now to look I saw some of it yesterday Incredible things. Made in the USA;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-006.wav|We're here today to celebrate and support the most incredible products in the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-007.wav|And this is just a very representative sampling because we're making more product here than we ever have;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-008.wav|Joining us today are manufacturers from all fifty states;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-009.wav|And they are terrific talents, terrific craftsmen, terrific businesspeople;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-010.wav|We have hats from Wyoming, sandals from Florida, tabasco from Louisiana;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-011.wav|Airstream trailers - the Airstream is a great trailer I've seen it for many years and they're doing better than ever - from Ohio, and custom-built motorcycles, from the great state of Indiana;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-012.wav|We also very represented and we have a lot of folks here from Litespeed Bikes, from Chattanooga Tennessee;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-013.wav|As a result of moving certain of its operations back to the United States I love to hear this, because that's what I like: when they move back, We don't have to make product in other countries;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-014.wav|Its parent company has experienced a seventy percent and that just happened. They just announced seventy percent growth over the last two years;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-015.wav|So they moved their operations back and they're seventy percent up in growth;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-016.wav|So I want to congratulate you Litespeed And I want to congratulate everybody;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-017.wav|And also a very special thank you to KC Andrews with Gameday Ironworks in Oklahoma for making this beautiful presidential seal;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-018.wav|It is a beauty I think we have it displayed someplace right here;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-019.wav|And I specifically said How much? Cause I want to buy it;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-020.wav|I don't know if they gave me a good price but we're going to get it We'll get it We'll put it up at the White House;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-021.wav|It's beautiful and so many of their other projects and products are incredible;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-022.wav|It was forged from American pride and with America pride and American craftsmanship and it was one hundred percent, American steel Our steel industry is doing very well;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-023.wav|We put massive tariffs on dumped steel They were dumping steel Our steel industry was going out of business If I hadn't been elected, you would have no steel industry right now. It would be gone;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-024.wav|And do we have not only steel, energy and so many other things;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-025.wav|We have - we're vibrant We have the hottest economy anywhere on Earth right now;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-026.wav|Today I also viewed boats that were proudly displayed by Cobalt Boats from Kansas and Freeman Boatworks from South Carolina;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-027.wav|and a farm irrigation system from Nebraska's T L Irrigation I want to thank those three companies It's not easy to get;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-028.wav|I also want to share our appreciation to Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson for showing us the incredible THAAD Missile Defense System the best in the world by far and for keeping the Sikorsky helicopter plant in Pennsylvania open;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-029.wav|saving four hunrder and sixty five jobs I called Marillyn, a number of weeks ago I said I read a story where they're going to be closing your helicopter plant;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-030.wav|in Pennsylvania We couldn't do that I said Marillyn you got to do something I don't wanna And I really appreciate it Marillyn They're keeping the plant open Everybody in;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-031.wav|Some of the manufacturers represented today have been around for a long time - more than a century in a couple of cases;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-032.wav|Johnson Woolen Mills was founded in Vermont before the Civil War;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-033.wav|Today Stacy Manosh is the fourth generation of her family to run the company And Stacy wherever you may be - hi Stacy - please stand up Stacy;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-034.wav|Others are just getting started like the Snake Bite Company in Missouri I thought it might be a snake It has nothing to do with snakes. I'm happy about that;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-035.wav|And I looked at your product last night and it's uh incredible;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-036.wav|Kevin Kelly raised startup funding online just a few years ago, and now he's selling specialty bottly - bottle openers and so many other things on two continents;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-037.wav|And the product is amazing And, Kevin congratulations That's a great job;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-038.wav|Where does Snake Bite come from? Where does that term come from;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-039.wav|Ah yep I get it Okay;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-040.wav|Well it's been working right? It's been working;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-041.wav|But while those here today create many different goods you're also devoted to one of the, greatest missions on Earth: making the best products, from the best materials, with the best workers anywhere in the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-042.wav|right here in the United States of America Right? Made in America Made in the USA;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-043.wav|And you know when I took office I was told by the previous administration that manufacturing jobs would be disappearing. There was no way They said you'd need a miracle;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-044.wav|Right? You'd need a miracle Well we have a miracle, because we up we're up six hundred thousand manufacturing jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-045.wav|We've added more than six million jobs, since I was elected, including over one million jobs in manufacturing, engineering and construction;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-046.wav|As I said six hundred thousand jobs in pure manufacturing, and that number is going to go substantially higher;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-047.wav|Japan and other countries are at my absolute request order - call it whatever you want;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-048.wav|They're sending tremendous and building tremendous plants now in the United States;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-049.wav|We hadn't had auto plants, built in many many years;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-050.wav|And now we're having many in Michigan in Ohio, in Pennsylvania in Florida, in North Carolina, South Carolina;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-051.wav|Many many plants are being built and being expanded;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-052.wav|And that was not happening Our auto companies and many companies were leaving the United States. Now they're staying They have a big disincentive to leave;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-053.wav|We're not happy when they leave When they leave it's not the same;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-054.wav|Last year we saw the biggest increase in manufacturing jobs in more than twenty years;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-055.wav|Under my administration manufacturing's share of total job gains is the largest it's been by any President in over;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-056.wav|one half a century. And don't forget the old days they manufactured so, I'm competing against some pretty tough statistics;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-057.wav|and yet it's over fifty years Unemployment has also reached the lowest rate in our country in over fifty one years;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-058.wav|African American unemployment - if you look at African American Asian American Hispanic American unemployment, it's the lowest it's ever been in the history of our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-059.wav|Women's unemployment the lowest it's ever been in over seventy years;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-060.wav|And soon we're going to have the all-time record for women's unemployment;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-061.wav|And today American manufacturers are contributing two hundred and fifty billion dollars - think of that - two hundred and fifty billion dollars more to our economy;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-062.wav|than they contributed before this great election that took place in twenty sixteen;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-063.wav|indeed manufacturers, in your own way manufacturers with great talent - we're heeding the wisdom of our Founding Fathers by restoring our economic independence and reawakening;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-064.wav|our industrial might And that's what's happened;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-065.wav|Whether it's jobs or making something, that's exactly what happened;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-066.wav|Previous administrations allowed foreign countries to steal our jobs and plunder our wealth;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-067.wav|They stole our wealth;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-068.wav|They stole so much, and it was allowed to go on so long;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-069.wav|But it's not going on any longer;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-070.wav|You take a look at what's happening Look at today's front page in the Wall Street Journal;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-071.wav|You'll see where China has had its worst year in twenty seven years And I'm not looking for that. But we had a deal with China and they decided not to make that deal;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-072.wav|They said Let's renegotiate I said No thank you;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-073.wav|We're standing up for the American worker like our country has never stood up for the worker before - certainly not in the hundred year or fifty year era;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-074.wav|I think we can probably go back right to the beginning because nobody stood up for the worker like I'm standing up for the worker;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-075.wav|To protect our defense industrial base which is probably about the most important if you think;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-076.wav|we placed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel, which brought it not to a complete halt - we still get some and they're paying a lot of money right into the Treasury;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-077.wav|But it's been amazing the difference that it's had And for our farmers, we've taken in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from China;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-078.wav|But China stopped dealing with our farmers, so I asked our great Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue What kind of number are you talking about? What have they left? He said Sixteen billion dollars si, taken off the table. I said That's okay;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-079.wav|We've taken in much much more many times that in tariffs;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-080.wav|So I'm going to give the farmers, we're going to help them out because they are great patriots We're going to give them sixteen billion dollars And we just did. Been approved Been everything And I approved it;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-081.wav|They said You know, President Trump did great with the farmers The farmers love him and he loves them, so we'll hurt the farmers. Well, the farmers are patriots I never I hadn't had one farmer say Please make a fast deal sir;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-082.wav|Please make a fast deal The biggest beneficiary will be the farmers;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-083.wav|But the sixteen billion that wasn't spent, we're putting back into the farm and ag system. And the farmers are thrilled I must tell you that;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-084.wav|And we're taking the toughest-ever action to confront China's chronic trade abuse. They were doing numbers on us for many years I watched Sleepy Joe Biden the other day talking about China;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-085.wav|We would fight China on trade Well he didn't do it for - he's been there for like forty five years;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-086.wav|And he didn't do it in eight years because they ate our lunch during the Obama;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-087.wav|administration It was only recently, that well, I mean recently but lots of warnings for the last period of time;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-088.wav|And then you have statutory constraints where you can only go here here here;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-089.wav|And we did that right at the beginning;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-090.wav|And now they're paying a very big price and hopefully we'll see what happens, We're going to have good relationships with China President Xi is a friend of mine He's a good I used to say he's good friend of mine we're probably not quite as close now;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-091.wav|But, I have to be for our country. He's for China and I'm for, the USA and that's the way it's got to be;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-092.wav|And this should have never been allowed to happen;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-093.wav|We've been losing four five - and even more than that hundred billion fiv Think of it: five hundred billion dollars a year to China;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-094.wav|That doesn't include intellectual property theft and loss;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-095.wav|That doesn't include they say that's three hundred billion dollars Who knows what that is? A lot of people estimate it, but it's a lot. But they say it's three hundred billion So you add that to five hundred billion;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-096.wav|So we've been losing eight hundred billion dollars a year to China. So essentially we rebuilt China They've done a great job I'm not going to take it away And I don't blame China;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-097.wav|I blame our past Presidents and our past leaders for allowing a situation like that - so ridiculous to happen. And it's that way other than, the size of the number, it's that way also, for many other countries;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-098.wav|And we're working on a lot of them;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-099.wav|Uh we just uh approved and, again it's going to be subject to the House passing it, and maybe for political reasons they don't;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-100.wav|the U S M C A That's Mexico and Canada Great deal for the manufacturers Great deal for Lockheed, as you know, Marillyn;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-101.wav|So we have to get the Democrats to pass it They may or may not depending on how they feel politically It's all politics unfortunately;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-102.wav|It shouldn't be It should be love of our country it shouldn't be politics There should be no politics involved;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-103.wav|So the U S M C A will create up to six hundred thousand new American jobs, including seventy five thousand new auto jobs;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-104.wav|And now we need Congress to pass it So, call up your friends The Republicans are totally onboard;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-105.wav|Call the Democrats get them to pass it It's believe it or not, it's a deal loved by unions, by manufacturers, and maybe especially by the farmers;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-106.wav|It's something that's very very popular So call your local Democrat congressmen. I think the Senate will be actually very good;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-107.wav|We have a lot of bipartisan, support but they may not be able to show that support, because the leaders may not allow that to happen because they think that's a victory for Trump and we don't want to give Trump any victories, even though it would be very bad for our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-108.wav|But if it doesn't happen, I have a better plan, okay? So don't worry about it;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-109.wav|You always have to have plan B plan C - especially in politics, I can tell you;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-110.wav|We unleashed an American energy revolution And it is indeed a revolution. Nobody thought it would be possible;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-111.wav|We're now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on the planet Earth;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-112.wav|And I just had ANWR approved one of the largest sites anywhere in the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-113.wav|Uh they couldn't do it with Ronald Reagan They couldn't get it done They've been trying to get it done for many many years;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-114.wav|Many many decades they couldn't get it approved I got it approved. That's in Alaska;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-115.wav|One of the biggest maybe the biggest the biggest site in the world for oil and natural gas;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-116.wav|We passed massive tax cuts, so that American companies can beat their foreign competition Now you have a tremendous advantage now;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-117.wav|impossible disadvantage before, and now we've given you with what we've done a tremendous advantage;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-118.wav|And we did it to keep jobs, where they belong right here in the United States of America;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-119.wav|As a result almost one thousand four hundred companies, have announced that they're bringing their jobs back to the United States from overseas;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-120.wav|And that's just last year Think of that fourteen hundred companies bringing jobs back;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-121.wav|Who would think that's even possible;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-122.wav|But now it's the incentive;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-123.wav|Early in my presidency I ordered the federal government to live by two very simple but very crucial rules: Buy American and hire American;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-124.wav|You know it's called America First folks, It was never that way;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-125.wav|I mean for many many decades, it was everybody else first and we were the people that took care of other people's borders;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-126.wav|We'd protect other people's borders but we don't want to protect our own border;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-127.wav|We'd fight for the right of other countries to have a strong powerful border so nobody could come in, but our border was like a leaking sieve;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-128.wav|And that's changed so rapidly and so much;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-129.wav|A lot of things are happening We're building a wall as we speak even though we have about seven lawsuits trying to stop it from the Democrats and others;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-130.wav|But we're doing very well and we're doing well on the border Mexico has been of great help;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-131.wav|I told them I said Look, you're going to help us If they walk through your country - two thousand mile walk, Horrible things happen during that walk to people, especially to women and children. Horrible things;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-132.wav|Two thousand miles up from Guatemala;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-133.wav|They walk through our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-134.wav|So many the percentage of rape, they say is over thirty percent Think of it;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-135.wav|Remember when I mentioned that in my opening speech and everybody said Oh that's such a - such a terrible thing to mention Well, what I said is very small compared to the actual fact: over thirty percent;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-136.wav|The crime - human trafficking mostly of children and women;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-137.wav|Human trafficking sounds like an ancient term. You wouldn't think it's possible Human trafficking;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-138.wav|But the Internet has made human trafficking a much bigger business than it was ever, hundreds or even thousands of years ago The Internet;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-139.wav|a lot of good things happen with the Internet but a lot of bad things happen also;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-140.wav|So now our federal agencies are spending an additional twenty four billion dollars on buying your product We're buying, your product And I said specifically Let's buy American. You have the advantage. Before you didn't have any advantage at all Now you have an advantage;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-141.wav|You make your product in America, you have a much better chance of getting the deal;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-142.wav|Today I'm pleased to announce that we will begin our Buy American requirements, but even stronger;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-143.wav|Currently a product can be fifty percent foreign, and it still counts as American-made Figure that one out;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-144.wav|In just a few moments I will sign an executive order that will - that will eventually raise these standards up to seventy five percent and above;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-145.wav|so that domestic goods will have to have seventy five percent American, and ninety five percent for things such as iron and steel It's going to be ninety five percent;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-146.wav|We have great minds;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-147.wav|We produce great ore, great steel, great aluminum great everything But we weren't using them Most of them were closed And in some cases, they blame the environmentalists Most of them were closed They're not closed anymore or they won't be closed very long;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-148.wav|The philosophy of my administration is simple: If we can build it grow it or make it in the United States, we will;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-149.wav|When we choose American-made, something truly wonderful happens: Our communities thrive and flourish;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-150.wav|our neighborhoods bustle with commerce our children dream bigger and bolder, and the bonds of loyalty that unite us as citizens, become closer richer and deeper than ever before;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-151.wav|That's how we carry on the flaming torch of Americanism, as President Warren G Harding called it;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-152.wav|As Harding said we are forever devoted to safeguard America first;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-153.wav|to stabilize America first, to prosper America first, to think of America first;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-154.wav|to exalt America first, and to live for and revere America first. You never heard that before. You've been doing this for a long time;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-155.wav|I speaking to a couple of the folks that were responsible right here - Freeman, for this great boat, of which they are setting records right now;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-156.wav|Records by a lot. Not even close;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-157.wav|said over the last three years where's Freeman? Where are you folks? Where are you? Stand up please Great job;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-158.wav|And they were saying how well they're doing and that they've never heard this kind of talk before: Build in America They didn't hear that In fact it was the opposite! They were trying to;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-159.wav|steal your business and build it overseas build it in other countries including China, many others;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-160.wav|But that's not what this is all about And this is a hundred percent, made right here Thank you Congratulate everybody too please;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-161.wav|So thank you all for showcasing your awe inspiring products today, They are absolutely incredible;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-162.wav|Thank you for pouring out your heart your sweat and soul to make our nation even stronger;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-163.wav|Thank you for your unwavering commitment to this magnificent land that we love so much And I just want to end by saying may God bless;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-164.wav|the United States of America May God bless you all Thank you very much;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-165.wav|Thank you very much. Appreciate it;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-166.wav|Okay, you have any questions on uh how well our manufacturing business is doing press;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-167.wav|The press;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-168.wav|Wow that's a lot of press Look;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-169.wav|I didn't do that But I will tell you, with our country and I think everybody in this audience, these are great manufacturers, great workers in our audience too they brought a lot of their workers here;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-170.wav|If you're not happy here, then you can leave. As far as I'm concerned, if you hate our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-171.wav|That's what I said in a tweet which I guess some people think is controversial A lot of people love it by the way;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-172.wav|A lot of people love it. But if you're not happy in the U.S., if you're complaining all the time - very simply, you can leave, You can leave right now;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-173.wav|Come back if you want, don't come back. It's okay too;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-174.wav|But if you're not happy you can leave;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-175.wav|very racist statement somebody that would say that So, Speaker Pelosi said Make America white again;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-176.wav|that's a very racist statement I'm surprised she'd say that John, go ahead;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-177.wav|watching them all they do is complain;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-178.wav|So all I'm saying is, if they want to leave they can leave John. They can leave;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-179.wav|I mean I look at the one I look at Omar I don't know I never met her;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-180.wav|I hear the way she talks about al Qaeda. Al Qaeda has killed many Americans;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-181.wav|She said You can hold your chest out, you can - when I think of America huh when I think of al Qaeda, I can hold my chest out;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-182.wav|When she talked about the World Trade Center being knocked down Some people You remember the famous - some people. These are people that in my opinion hate our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-183.wav|Now you can say what you want, but get a list of all of the statements they've made;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-184.wav|And all I'm saying that if they're not happy here, they can leave;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-185.wav|I'm sure that there'll be many people that won't miss them;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-186.wav|They're Congress people. And I never used any names;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-187.wav|These are people that if they don't like it here they can leave;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-188.wav|I don't know who's going to miss them but I guess some people will;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-189.wav|When I hear people speaking about how wonderful al Qaeda is, when I hear people talking about some people! some people with the World Trade Center some people? No not some people Much more than some people;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-190.wav|When I hear the statements that they've made - and in one case you have somebody that comes from, Somalia which is a failed government, a failed state;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-191.wav|who left Somalia who ultimately came here, and now is a Congresswoman who's never happy, says horrible things about Israel;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-192.wav|Hates Israel. Hates Jews. Hates Jews. It's very simple;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-193.wav|And if the Democrats want to wrap their bows around this group of four people - one of them kept Amazon out of New York, tens of thousands of jobs Would've been a great thing;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-194.wav|And she kept Amazon from going it would've been a good deal I mean, could he have made better? Maybe;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-195.wav|But tens of thousands of jobs, and New York has not been the same since that happened;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-196.wav|It's really hurt New York and New York City, Amazon was going to go there They were going to relocate a major section of their business in New York. She kept them out;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-197.wav|That was a terrible thing she did;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-198.wav|So here's the story - here's the story: I see them complaining. They're complaining constantly;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-199.wav|I watched Lindsey Graham today on Fox and Friends talking about the same subject - and frankly, even stronger than what I'm saying He said they're communists I'm saying;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-200.wav|I'm saying that they're socialists definitely. As to whether or not they're communists I would think they might be, but this isn't what our country is about Nevertheless, they're free to leave if they want;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-201.wav|And if they want to leave that's fine And if they want to stay that's fine;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-202.wav|But the people have to know And politicians can't be afraid to take them on;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-203.wav|A politician that hears somebody, where we're at war with al Qaeda, and sees somebody talking about how great al Qaeda is pick out her statement - that was Omar;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-204.wav|How great al Qaeda is - when you hear that - and we're losing great soldiers, to al Qaeda;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-205.wav|When you see the World Trade Center gets knocked down, and you see the statements made about the World Trade Center all the death and destruction - I'll tell you what: I'm not happy with them;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-206.wav|And it's very easy to be say Oh, gee, Well, it's okay. If weak politicians want to say;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-207.wav|and the Democrats in this case - if they wanna, gear their wagons around these four people, I think they're going to have a very tough election because I don't think the people of United States will stand for it;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-208.wav|he just said Don't go See, I disagree with Lindsey. What am I supposed to do? Just wait for senators? No;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-209.wav|These are four so I disagree with Lindsey on that That was the only thing;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-210.wav|He said Aim higher. Shoot higher What am I going to do Wait til we get somebody else in a higher position? A higher office? These are people that hate our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-211.wav|Hey John, They hate our country. They hate it, I think with a passion. Now it's possible I'm wrong, The voter will decide;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-212.wav|But when I hear the way they talk about our country, when I hear the anti-Semitic language they use when I hear the hatred they have for Israel, and the love they have for enemies like al Qaeda;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-213.wav|this is good for the Democrat Party. Certainly it's not the party that I've known over the years;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-214.wav|because many people agree with me. And all I'm saying - they want to leave they can leave Now, it doesn't say leave forever;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-215.wav|It says leave if you want But what it says and what that - John what that says is: If they're not happy with the United States;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-216.wav|if they're doing nothing but criticizing us all the time you see these, people walking down criticizing the United States;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-217.wav|We just hit the highest stock market in history. All of these incredible manufacturers that are in - these are great business people They employ many people, and we have workers with us too;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-218.wav|They're having the best year they've ever had. Can I say that? Is that a correct statement;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-219.wav|and they're hiring more people than they've had And more people are making a good living than they've ever had. We just hit, twenty seven thousand plus, on the Dow;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-220.wav|It's the highest the stock market has ever been;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-221.wav|And you have to go by the election because the markets started going up the day after I won;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-222.wav|You know they like to add all of that tremendous gain;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-223.wav|They like to try and give it to Obama. The fact is if I would've lost, the stock market would crash;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-224.wav|And if these people that I watch in those debates ever got their hands on the United States government, four o one keys, the values of your company, everything else that we talk about we're so proud of, it's down the tubes;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-225.wav|People will lose their money;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-226.wav|They'll lose their wealth;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-227.wav|You'll have a crash like you've never seen before. And I'm really good at this stuff I know what I'm talking about;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-228.wav|People came into our country illegally. Illegally. Many were felons. Many were convicted of crimes;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-229.wav|Many many were taken out on Sunday. You just didn't know about it;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-230.wav|I spoke to a couple of people;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-231.wav|We had many people it was a very successful day. But you didn't see a lot of it;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-232.wav|And I don't I'm not even sure they should be telling you but it was a lot;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-233.wav|And it wouldn't have to be Sunday We've been doing this look we have been removing MS thirteen They're monsters;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-234.wav|We've been removing MS thirteen by the thousands during my administration;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-235.wav|And I tell my people it's much easier to go the other route - but I say Focus on the criminals. Focus on the people that are killing people, that are causing crime. Focus on them;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-236.wav|Much easier just to go to general population, That's easy. But I don't do it the easy way;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-237.wav|We're getting tremendous numbers of criminals. And yesterday it was just reported to me before I walked because I said, How did that go yesterday It didn't have to start yesterday;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-238.wav|The truth is it started a number of days before yesterday but yesterday was very successful;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-239.wav|People come into our country illegally, and they go out legally;
./myfolder/VOICE/52-240.wav|Every person taken out had papers and we had court orders. Okay thank you;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-001.wav|discuss a very strong and groundbreaking achievement for the United States and Japan: the signing of the new U S Japan;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-002.wav|Trade Agreement and the U S Japan Digital Trade Agreement Digital is becoming a very big factor in the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-003.wav|These two deals represent a tremendous victory for both of our nations;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-004.wav|They will create countless jobs expand investment and commerce reduce our trade deficit very substantially, promote fairness and reciprocity and unlock the vast opportunities for growth;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-005.wav|In the United States these deals are a game changer for our farmers and our ranchers we love our farmers and we love our ranchers we've been working very hard on this - providing them with significantly enhanced access to a critical foreign market;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-006.wav|In a moment I'll really honoring a lot of the folks in the room, that are here with us from, farm country, ranch country;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-007.wav|And we're going to be witnessing a historic signing by Ambassador Robert Lighthizer and Ambassador, from Japan - a long trip but you just got here - Sugiyama of Japan;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-008.wav|And we're grateful to both of you for the outstanding job you've done and all of the people that were involved with both of you your staffs and your representatives Thank you both very much Bob thank you Thank you very much. It's a lot of work;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-009.wav|We're also delighted that Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao is here;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-010.wav|Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Stephen Censky is here;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-011.wav|A very great gentleman a very popular man too in the world and especially his wonderful state, Steve Daines;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-012.wav|Representatives Jodey Arrington and Kevin Hern. And thank you fellas for being here As well as, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-013.wav|North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-014.wav|Iowa Lieutenant Governor Adam Gregg;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-015.wav|And many other state and local officials We have some tremendously respected people here political people I want to extend a special welcome to all of the leaders;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-016.wav|here today representing American farmers and ranchers benefitting from this deal - this is a tremendously important deal and a very big deal - including those from our beef, pork, poultry, wheat, dairy, and corn associations;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-017.wav|I would particularly like to recognize Zippy. Zippy Duvall He's been with us from the beginning Zippy;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-018.wav|He's the President and CEO of the American Farm Bureau Federation;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-019.wav|We're also joined by several senior leaders from our nation's top technology companies including Chris Padilla of IBM;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-020.wav|Peggy Johnson of Microsoft. Peggy thank you very much, being here. Please say hello too;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-021.wav|And Craig Albright of Business Software Alliance;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-022.wav|We do appreciate your support and it really is now smart farming;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-023.wav|going to MIT doesn't hurt either right? When you're a farmer nowadays It's incredible what they do;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-024.wav|From day one my administration has fought tirelessly to achieve a level playing field for the American worker;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-025.wav|In addition to the agreements we're signing with Japan today we reached a tremendous agreement with Mexico and Canada to replace NAFTA;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-026.wav|with the new USMCA. And hopefully that'll get done, in the not too distant future Everybody wants it. Manufacturers want it farmers want it;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-027.wav|And that's a great deal for all of the countries but in particular it's a great deal for us and our workers;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-028.wav|We're also completely renegotiating and now we've completed that and signed it the US Korea Trade Agreement to substantially expanding American auto exports;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-029.wav|It's made a tremendous difference That was a terrible agreement and we renegotiated it and it's now a very good agreement for the United States It was not a good agreement for the United States at all;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-030.wav|Today's signing of the U S Japan Trade Agreement and U S Japan Digital Trade Agreement bills on these incredible successes to the benefit of both of our nations And I have to say that while we're here;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-031.wav|and because of the fact that we're talking about agriculture, ethanol and the farmers of, Nebraska and Iowa and all of the different places that wanted it;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-032.wav|we've come to an agreement And it's going to be, I guess about getting close to sixteen;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-033.wav|And also and very importantly, we've taken in tremendous amounts of money in the form of tariffs from China China has eaten;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-034.wav|the cost of those tariffs because they've devalued their currency and they've also pumped a lot of money into their system;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-035.wav|we have no inflation;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-036.wav|If anything it's going below the number, so therefore we're entitled to an interest rate cut I hope the Fed does that;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-037.wav|because we'd be like a rocket ship. And we're already the strongest economy in the world and doing better than just about any economy in the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-038.wav|a lot of people are asking us the secret But we'd like to see an interest rate cut - a very substantial one;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-039.wav|whatever else they want to do. But we would be a rocket ship;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-040.wav|And if you look at from the time I got elected - if you go to November nineth the day after the election - uh we're up close to sixty percent in the market which is numbers that are pretty much unheard of;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-041.wav|because it's a fairly short period of time. Our country is doing really well;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-042.wav|But we are taking care of our farmers out of the billions and billions of dollars that we've gotten You know about that Zippy right;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-043.wav|So we're giving twelve billion from the year before twelve billion;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-044.wav|And that's compliments of China Thank you very much And sixteen billion, this last year;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-045.wav|And then we'll see what happens next year Maybe by that time it's straightened out;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-046.wav|But the farmers and ranchers were targeted, to put it mildly, by China;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-047.wav|And it's nice that they're coming back. And, by the way, China is also coming here on - their representatives they're coming on Thursday and Friday, Bob I believe;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-048.wav|The relationship is very good As to whether or not we make a deal I don't know But there's certainly a good possibility But the relationship is is a very good one;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-049.wav|But we've taken in billions of dollars And of those many many more billions we're giving sixteen billion to our farmers because I asked;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-050.wav|Sonny Perdue - I said Sonny what was the amount of money that last year that the farmers were hurt He said Sir Let me get back to you He got back to me The number was sixteen billion dollars;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-051.wav|I said That's okay We're going to take sixteen billion out of the tariffs and we're going to give it to the American farmer. And I think they appreciated that It never gets reported by the;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-052.wav|fake news as I say But never gets reported. Never I don't know why They don't want to do it;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-053.wav|And then Zippy as you know we took twelve billion from the year before;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-054.wav|And that also came from large amounts of tariff and tariffs And people were actually saying I read a report today I believe in the Washington Times;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-055.wav|where they talked about the tremendous amount of money that has actually come in from tariffs;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-056.wav|And it's been a number that we've never even seen before in this country We've had a tremendous amount of money coming in And some of the Republican;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-057.wav|senators and it's not a bad idea said Why don't we give it Because we have a lot of money left over after taking care of our farmers And;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-058.wav|what we're doing is we're bringing it right up to the level that the farmers were targeted by;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-059.wav|So in theory they should be - it should be in its own way, a level playing field The amazing thing about the farmer, been with so many they don't even want that right;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-060.wav|They just want a level playing field They don't even want sixteen billion dollars;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-061.wav|I think almost anybody else Larry Kudlow wants sixteen billion dollars The farmer doesn't want it. They want a level playing field They want to play the game;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-062.wav|the way it should be played And I think we're probably pretty close to doing that too But in the meantime no other President would get sixteen billion dollars and twelve billion dollars for the American farmer or rancher that I can tell you;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-063.wav|It was all of us Everybody standing up here frankly;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-064.wav|Under the terms of the agreement today Japan has committed to dramatically increase market access to American food and agricultural exports;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-065.wav|It's a very dramatic number It's one of the larger trade deals ever signed As a result a hundred and twenty six million Japanese consumers will have greater access to high quality American almonds;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-066.wav|blueberries, corn wine, poultry, and egg products, beef, pork wheat and so much more;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-067.wav|Once this agreement enters into force Japanese tariffs will be completely eliminated so that Japan will not be;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-068.wav|charging us as they have for many many years and that's we appreciate it and substantially reduced over ninety percent of the United States agricultural exports;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-069.wav|That's a big thing because we're getting charged a lot of tariffs. And it's okay for us to charge but we can't have other countries charge;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-070.wav|Our farmers, ranchers, and growers will now be able to compete fairly in Japan against major competitors worldwide;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-071.wav|In addition to these agricultural agreements the extraordinary digital agreement, that we're signing, so that digital agreement is a very big deal in its own right;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-072.wav|we're signing today sets standards on the forty billion dollars in digital trade between the United States and Japan And we just won a big talking about digital and talking about the Internet but we just won the big case;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-073.wav|as you know And you people would really know right;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-074.wav|But that was a big case that we won on net neutrality. Just won it;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-075.wav|And that's a going to receive maybe they won't even appeal it because it's a very hard case to appeal but it was a tremendous victory in terms of speed and in terms of investment on the Internet;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-076.wav|This deal is remarkable in that it will ensure that Americans have a level playing field in trading cutting-edge products and services such as videos music e books and software;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-077.wav|These comprehensive provisions meet the gold standard of digital trade rules that were set in the landmark USMCA;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-078.wav|And again we hope that's going to get voted on We hope that Nancy Pelosi gets it voted on because everyone wants it and she'll have to make her own decision Let her make her own decision;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-079.wav|But I can tell you the American public is tired of Do Nothing;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-080.wav|And we are doing a lot and the Democrats are doing nothing;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-081.wav|Thriving commerce between the United States and Japan is essential to advancing opportunity and prosperity for our people;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-082.wav|The United States and Japan are the world's largest and third largest economies Together our nations comprise nearly one-third of the entire globe's G D P;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-083.wav|Japan is America's third largest agricultural export market;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-084.wav|and this makes it even bigger And America is Japan's foreign investor and that's what I was talking about all of the plants that are going up all over the country I said;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-085.wav|to Prime Minister Abe Please we need auto plants And I said that right at the beginning when I first met with him and immediately liked him a lot;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-086.wav|They've really produced doing a lot of plants not just auto Many many;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-087.wav|many many plants and factories are being built in the United States by Japan and Japanese companies;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-088.wav|These agreements will ensure that our economic partnership flourishes brighter than ever before;

./myfolder/VOICE/53-108.wav|Okay so we've had a tremendous success. Likewise we're having a lot of successes;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-109.wav|And the border is really doing well And again Mexico today has twenty seven thousand soldiers;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-110.wav|Twenty seven thousand;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-111.wav|I want to thank the President of Mexico because he's been great;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-112.wav|But the border is really looking good The wall is moving rapidly;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-113.wav|Large sections are being built every day More contracts are being given out We're we're doing it in about seventeen different sections because it's over;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-114.wav|Four hundred and fifty miles long the area we have to close up;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-115.wav|And we expect to have anywhere between four and five hundred built hopefully by the end of next year It's going up very rapidly It's a very;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-116.wav|it's a very powerful wall;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-117.wav|got everything you can have It was and the Border Patrol just left actually We were going over some of the numbers and;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-118.wav|we gave them every single element of the wall that they wanted;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-119.wav|we had mountain climbers literally come in Which is the hardest one to climb? The panel the steel panel on top makes it very difficult It's called an anti climb panel;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-120.wav|And the border is coming along well The economy is doing great We're doing as I said before we're the hottest economy in the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-121.wav|We're the largest economy in the world We're up fifteen trillion dollars at least since the election;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-122.wav|Fifteen trillion And China is down probably twenty two or twenty four trillion;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-123.wav|So I think China might have caught us if my opponent had gotten in by now they would have caught us;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-124.wav|And now it's going to be a long time before they catch us if they ever catch us I don't think anybody is going to catch us;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-125.wav|If we're smart nobody will catch us;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-126.wav|So with that being said, if you have any questions on the trade deal please;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-127.wav|Anything on the trade deal specifically;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-128.wav|Well they want to make a deal They're down three and a half million jobs since we, started doing what we do;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-129.wav|And their supply chain is really cracked and broken;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-130.wav|And they want to make a deal. Now they're coming to see us on Thursday and Friday;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-131.wav|We think there is a chance that we could do something very substantial Bob I think you think that We'll see what happens;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-132.wav|But in the meantime we're taking in billions and billions of dollars of tariffs every month, we've never had this We never took in ten cents from China;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-133.wav|tens of billions a year;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-134.wav|And on October fifteenth as you know it goes up from up to thirty five as it goes a to thirty five It's going to - it's going to raise fairly substantially;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-135.wav|We could always do it a lot more but we've decided not to;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-136.wav|So that's the story. And I think that they will - they're coming to make a deal. We'll see whether or not a deal can be made, but it's got to be a fair deal Look we've lost five hundred billion dollars a year for many many years on average;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-137.wav|If you include intellectual property theft and all of the other things that took place it's incredible that past administrations could have allowed it to happen;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-138.wav|We're talking about five hundred billion not million, that's a lot too, five hundred billion dollars a year for many years;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-139.wav|taken out of our country We rebuilt China They did a great job and I don't blame them I told President Xi I don't blame you one bit. I blame the people that ran this country to allow that to happen;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-140.wav|And they understand that;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-141.wav|But we don't let that happen anymore. So we'll see what happens We're going to have a, very important meeting And they have their top people coming in And I have my top people doing the job And if I don't think they're doing a good job;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-142.wav|Well we'd like to see a very humane solution to that. I hope that's going to happen;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-143.wav|And, you know Hong Kong is very important as a, as a world hub not just for China but for the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-144.wav|And you have great people over there I see they're flying the American flags;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-145.wav|They even, have signs;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-146.wav|But they have, you know tremendous signage and tremendous - they have a tremendous spirit for our country a lot of American flags a lot of a lot of Trump signs;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-147.wav|of the group But i i really think they can do something We just want to see a humane solution;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-148.wav|No I didn't But I do say that we are negotiating. If anything happened bad I think that would be a very bad for the negotiation I think politically it would be very tough;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-149.wav|maybe for us, and maybe for some others and maybe for him;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-150.wav|But, no i i think that they have to do that in a peaceful manner;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-151.wav|I will say the first time I saw it if you look a number of months ago I saw two million people I've never seen anything like it;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-152.wav|We talk about crowd size That was serious crowd size right;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-153.wav|The crowd size is much smaller now, so maybe that's saying something;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-154.wav|But hopefully they can work out something that's amicable;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-155.wav|Well it's a very good question I think it's not what we prefer at all;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-156.wav|They are starting to buy a lot of our agricultural products You see that;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-157.wav|They're coming in very strong on pork also very very strong, and in particular But on other products, that - so I don't know if you call that a partial We don't have an agreement;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-158.wav|My inclination is to get a big deal We've come this far. We're doing well;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-159.wav|Again, the fact that they've done what they've done with their currency the devaluation - it really has not increased prices;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-160.wav|And now we're talking China It doesn't mean that in all cases that happens other countries prices increase, but in the case of China that hasn't happened;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-161.wav|and they put a lot of money into their, into their goods. They want to keep their people working I understand that very well;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-162.wav|But I think that we just have to see what happens I would much prefer a big deal And I think that's what we're shooting for Can something happen I guess maybe. Who knows;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-163.wav|But I think it's probably unlikely;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-164.wav|Well I'm not siding with anybody. We've been in Syria for many years You know Syria was supposed to be a short term hit - just a very short-term hit And we were supposed to be in and out;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-165.wav|That was many many years ago. And we only have fifty people in that area That's a small sector;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-166.wav|And I don't want those fifty people hurt or killed or anything I don't want anything bad to happen to our people And I told that;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-167.wav|to President Erdogan I said Don't hurt any of our - any of our people get hurt, big trouble. Now, a couple of things: I think there's a lot of pressure on Turkey;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-168.wav|They have been fighting with the P K K for, many years They're natural enemies If you read today a couple of reports saying that when President Obama started this whole thing as you know it was started by;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-169.wav|President Obama - he created a natural war with Turkey and their, their long-time enemy, PKK;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-170.wav|they're still there And they're still hating each other beyond anybody's belief;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-171.wav|But i, I have told Turkey that if they do anything outside of what;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-172.wav|we would think is, humane to use the word a second time we talk about Hong Kong, we talk about this - they could suffer the wrath of an extremely decimated economy;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-173.wav|And I've done it once I did it with Pastor Brunson. You remember the Pastor Brunson;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-174.wav|They wouldn't give Pastor Brunson back and they ended up giving Pastor Brunson back pretty quickly;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-175.wav|Their currency fell at record levels and lots of other things happened;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-176.wav|Uh I want to see it happen. I will tell you this though: We defeated ISIS;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-177.wav|When I wanted to - when we were at ninety six and ninety five and ninety seven percent, I sort of said Let the other countries in the area finish it off;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-178.wav|I was met with a lot of anger from some people in our country I said All right I'll finish it off;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-179.wav|And I got together with our generals I flew to Iraq I got together And we did it very quickly Far quicker than any general, from here told us we could do it We have some great people over there They did it quickly;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-180.wav|And I said to the European countries You've got to take your ISIS You know we have;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-181.wav|Sixty thousand maybe even seventy thousand people - that includes families, that includes wives of fighters that were killed. We have many fighters that were killed in the battles;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-182.wav|And we took it Over a hundred percent of the caliphate I took over quickly;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-183.wav|Nobody else was it was a mess when I came to office And I think most of you would agree to that;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-184.wav|It was a real mess;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-185.wav|I took it over But then I said, What are we going to do with these sixty to seventy thousand people that are;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-186.wav|being held and being guarded and we can't release them And many fighters also;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-187.wav|And I said I want them to go back to Germany, to France, to different European countries from where they came;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-188.wav|And I said to the European countries - I said to all of them Take the people back;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-189.wav|And they said No no no We don't want to do it We don't them back I said Well, they came from Germany or they came from France Take them back;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-190.wav|And they're so used to the United States being a sucker, being a fool - we're talking about billions and billions of dollars You're talking about life You're talking about so many things so many elements;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-191.wav|and elements of complexity Because they're going to walk back into Germany. They're going to go back into these countries from where they came;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-192.wav|So I said Take them back. And they said No And then I said again I'm going to give you another thirty days Take them back;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-193.wav|they kept saying No Maybe they won't be saying no now I don't know;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-194.wav|I told President Erdogan, You got to - it's going to be your responsibility Now really who's responsible it's really;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-195.wav|Russia, it's Turkey, it's Iran it's Iraq, and it's Syria and anybody else in the neighborhood. Okay? We call it the neighborhood It's not a friendly neighborhood;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-196.wav|But these countries should do it Now ISIS is the sworn enemy of all of these countries;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-197.wav|Many of them they hate far more than they hate us, and those countries hate them at the same level, as we do. They're terrible, terrible, savage killers;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-198.wav|I said Take them back. But these countries are rich in most cases;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-199.wav|They're powerful. They've got armies. They can do the work;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-200.wav|But we're not bringing fifty, sixty seventy or even ten thousand people to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-201.wav|We're not going to paying them for the next fifty years, or paying to take care of them for the next fifty years So we told;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-202.wav|Europe we did a great service to the world. And we did a great service to Europe in particular where so many of these fighters came from;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-203.wav|We said Take them back And, you know unfortunately, like NATO, they take advantage. NATO, as you know I got the Secretary General Stolheim said;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-204.wav|and I think very loudly Secretary General of NATO, said that because of what I did they have paid over one hundred billion dollars more money toward NATO defense But that's still not enough, okay It's still not enough Not fair;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-205.wav|Because United States pays far too much relative;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-206.wav|And obviously NATO affects them more But like NATO, like trade with the European Union which is a very tough group to trade with - very very tough group. Almost as tough as Japan not quite;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-207.wav|But they are a very tough group to trade with;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-208.wav|They take advantage And I said Look you take them back. We're not - we're not going to do this We're not going to put in Guantanamo Bay and put them all over our prisons;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-209.wav|Right now we're at a position where, if Turkey does anything out of what they should be doing we will hit them so hard on the economy But when you talk about soldiers;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-210.wav|we only had fifty soldiers in the area I think the area was it's a very small area, and very small area. But we only had fifty soldiers there;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-211.wav|I don't want them to be in a bad or compromising position. And I will tell you this: Everybody respects our country again;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-212.wav|If we want to go in, we have to go back for any reason - because bad things happen But we're seven thousand miles away;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-213.wav|These ISIS people whatever you want to call them, these people are right there. They're right there They're touching many of these countries that I just named;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-214.wav|Iran as an example, hates ISIS And ISIS hates Iran. Iraq you know all about that;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-215.wav|Turkey, Syria, let them take care of it. Let them take care of it;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-216.wav|We want to bring our troops back home. It's been many many years. It's been decades in many cases;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-217.wav|We want to bring our troops back home;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-218.wav|And I got elected on that If you go back and look at our speeches I would say We want to bring our troops back home from these endless wars. And we're like a police force over there;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-219.wav|We're policing. We're not fighting we're policing;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-220.wav|We're not a police force. We're the greatest military force ever assembled because of what I've done over the last three years with two and a half trillion dollars;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-221.wav|Mr. Ambassador we've spent on our military two and a half trillion dollars. But we're not going to be there, longer;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-222.wav|And we're going to be watching Turkey and we hope that them and all of the other countries-or some of the other countries including the European Union goes in, and does whatever they're supposed to do with these captured, ISIS fighters and families;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-223.wav|I always consult with everybody. If you remember, about eight months ago I talked about doing this;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-224.wav|And we kept two thousand people there, and then slowly brought them out. But once we captured ISIS I didn't see I don't want to stay there for the next forty years;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-225.wav|I have great respect for all of the people that you named. And they have their opinion and a lot of people do And I could also name;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-226.wav|many more than you just named of people that totally are supportive You see the names coming out people are extremely thrilled, because they say it's time to bring our people back home We're not a police force They're policing the area We're not a police force;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-227.wav|The UK, was very thrilled at this decision As you know they're over there - they have soldiers over there also And others;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-228.wav|But many people agree with it very strongly And I understand both sides of it I, fully understand both sides of it;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-229.wav|But I campaigned on the fact that I was going to bring our soldiers home, and bring them home as rapidly as possible;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-230.wav|I, we, all together, you - we defeated and took over hundred percent of the ISIS caliphate Everybody said that was going to be an impossible thing to do I did it and I did it quickly because we have a great military now;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-231.wav|When I took over our military we didn't have ammunition;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-232.wav|I was told by a top general, maybe the top of them all, Sir, I'm sorry Sir we don't have ammunition I said I'll never let another President have that happen to him or her. We didn't have ammunition;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-233.wav|Now we've captured ISIS We've done what we've done We had fifty soldiers in the area you're talking about;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-234.wav|I said We want to bring our soldiers back home It's been a long time. Again we were supposed to be in there for a just a tiny spot. Like a thirty to ninety day period. That was many years ago. It's time;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-235.wav|Kurds as you know that was that's a natural enemy of, of Turkey;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-236.wav|You know specifically as I said. I mean they have natural enemies. They've been fighting each other for - somebody said today hundreds of years I mean, one historian said they've been fighting for hundreds of years;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-237.wav|We interject ourself into wars and we interject ourselves into tribal wars and revolutions and all of these things that are very - they're not the kind of thing that you settle the way we'd like to see it settled;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-238.wav|It just doesn't - it just doesn't work that way. But hopefully that'll all be very strong and strongly done;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-239.wav|We're spending tremendous amounts of money I can tell you the two countries that are most disappointed that we're leaving are China and Russia because they love that we're bogged down;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-240.wav|and just watching and spending tremendous amounts of money instead of continuing to build our forces We have tremendous new weapons under development now We have;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-241.wav|weapons that nobody can even believe We're going to be making some stops over the next four or five weeks, Some we show some we don't show;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-242.wav|But we've rebuilt our nuclear We've, uh, renovated and rebuilt nuclear;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-243.wav|We're building submarines the likes of which has - they've never been even thought of before, the genius of them. Hopefully and hope to God we never have to use them;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-244.wav|But we are doing what we have to do. But we've been there for many years Long many many many years beyond what we were supposed to be;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-245.wav|And it's time to come back home. But I can understand the other side of it. But if you go by the other side that means we should never ever come home. We should never ever come home;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-246.wav|And you know I have to sign letters often to parents of young soldiers that were killed;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-247.wav|And it's the hardest thing I have to do in this job. I hate it, I hate it. Afghanistan, I signed one the other day Iraq, Syria;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-248.wav|They get blown up by mines, They get taken out by a sniper. And I have to write letters to people. And we make each letter different;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-249.wav|Each person is different. And we make them personal But no matter what you do it's devastating. The parents will never be the same The families will never be the same;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-250.wav|People are killed Many people are still being killed;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-251.wav|And we're willing to do what we have to do, but there has to be an end game;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-252.wav|And if you stay it's going to be the same thing Eventually you're going to have to leave It's going to be the same thing;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-253.wav|So, I think what we're doing is the right thing A lot of people agree with me. A lot of people agree with me And again you go back and see my speeches;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-254.wav|a big part of my speech and always when I won what some people consider to be a surprise election now I just see a poll that just came out where I'm up massively with independent voters;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-255.wav|I don't know if it's this or because of the hoax, you know that's going on with Nancy Pelosi and her - her friend, Adam Schiff. He's another beauty;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-256.wav|He got caught lying all over the place He doesn't know what to do He's a mess, Right now he's a mess;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-257.wav|And everybody knows it. Just all you have to do is a little good reporting you'll see he's a total mess because he got caught;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-258.wav|But you know we have to do the right thing for our country whether it whatever it may be And I just think that's the right thing;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-259.wav|I respect both opinions. Problem with the other opinion is: When do we leave;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-260.wav|Well first of all the impeachment inquiry is a scam;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-261.wav|The conversation that I had with the Ukrainian President Zelensky was a very good conv it was a very cordial very good conversation;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-262.wav|The mistake they made - the opponents, the opposition, the Democrats, the radical Left, deep state, whatever you want to call them - they came out with a whistleblower report before they saw the conversation;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-263.wav|Had they waited one day Nancy Pelosi wouldn't have made a fool out of herself and she would have been able to say what I said Because when she saw it, she said This is not what the whistleblower said;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-264.wav|I had a very, very congenial, nice conversation with a man that I like. And he ran on corruption;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-265.wav|Because as you know Ukraine is known as a very corrupt country - one of the most in the world shockingly because I know Ukrainian people It's surprising to me But it's known as one of the most corrupt;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-266.wav|countries And under the past leadership it was having a lot of difficulty This gentleman the current President the new President ran on the basis of anti corruption, as you know I think it was his single biggest thing;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-267.wav|We had a great conversation, but it wasn't reported that way The only reason I would have released a letter because I think it's terrible to have to release a letter that you have with the leader of a country I think it's a terrible precedent;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-268.wav|But the whistleblower report or whatever the news was, was so off It was so horrible;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-269.wav|I said I never said that. I said Let me see it We have a stenographer report. We have a very, very uhh word for word report of what I said I released it;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-270.wav|And almost everybody that read it said it's either perfect or really very good. But it's a very normal, nice conversation;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-271.wav|And when you see, that the President of Ukraine, President Zelensky said, There was no pressure put on me whatsoever His spokesman came out two days ago said there was absolutely no pressure put on the President I didn't tell him to say that;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-272.wav|There was no pressure put on him All you have to do is read the report;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-273.wav|a day after they had already made their big statements;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-274.wav|And, again it's a big scam. And I think Adam Schiff, should be investigated for what he did He took to the great Chamber Congress and he made a speech;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-275.wav|And his speech, was, a fraud;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-276.wav|Everything he said was a fraud;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-277.wav|He, went out as though I wrote it. He defrauded the American people. He defrauded Congress;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-278.wav|I think he's having some kind of a breakdown. Because he got up and made a speech that bore no relationship to what the conversation was;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-279.wav|And I'll tell you a lot of people heard that speech and a lot of people thought that's what I said because they heard his speech;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-280.wav|Because they're not going to read a three or four page conversation;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-281.wav|They don't have access to it;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-282.wav|But I thought it was one of the, I thought it was a terrible thing, where he's going up speaking as the President of the United States, saying things that I never said;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-283.wav|And the meaning was horrible. And the whole thought was horrible;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-284.wav|And then the whistleblower, he did through his committee, through himself - he met with a whistleblower. They never said that. They never talked about it;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-285.wav|And Nancy Pelosi knew all of this stuff I mean she's as guilty as he is because she knew all that;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-286.wav|She knew everything about it. And she didn't do anything about it;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-287.wav|They should really be looked at very strongly because what they did is unthinkable What they did to this country is unthinkable;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-288.wav|And it's lucky that I'm the President because I guess I don't know why a lot of people said very few people could handle it. I sort of thrive on it You know why Because;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-289.wav|because it's so important, that we get to the bottom We went through the whole Mueller scam, two and a half years;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-290.wav|We went through that And I had three four days where it was like over;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-291.wav|And then I'm walking into the United Nations and they released it as I'm walking in, Mr. Ambassador I'm walking in;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-292.wav|I'm going to meet with I won't name but one of the top leaders of the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-293.wav|And I see up on the screen and people start screening about this scam called impeachment. You can't impeach a President for doing a great job;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-294.wav|You can't impeach a President for having the lowest and best unemployment numbers that we've had in fifty one years;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-295.wav|tax cuts and regulation cuts and creating and even the Ambassador would say the strongest economy in the world;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-296.wav|We have the strongest economy in the world. This is a scam;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-297.wav|And the people are wise to it And that's why my polls went up I think they said seventeen points in the last two or three days I've never had that one;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-298.wav|I've never had that one So I think it's very sad for our country;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-299.wav|I think it makes it harder to do my job;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-300.wav|But I do my job and I do it better than anybody has done it for the first two and half years based on results i mean you look at;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-301.wav|not only the unemployment numbers look at the employment numbers Jeff we have;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-302.wav|we're up to almost a hundred and sixty million people are working;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-303.wav|And now today we've signed the deal with Japan which is such an honor;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-304.wav|And uhh you have a great country - a great, great country and to;
./myfolder/VOICE/53-306.wav|I look forward to seeing you for many years to come please again wish Prime Minister Abe a happy birthday he's a very special man;
